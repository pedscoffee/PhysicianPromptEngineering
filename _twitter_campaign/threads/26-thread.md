TWEET 2/5:
Local AI models: Some tools run entirely on your device (LM Studio, Ollama). No internet required.

---

TWEET 3/5:
Quality tradeoff: Local models currently less capable than cloud-based AI. Improving rapidly though.

---

TWEET 4/5:
Hybrid approach: Use cloud AI normally, have local backup for outages. Redundancy prevents complete workflow failure.

---

TWEET 5/5:
Traditional backup: Keep your templates ready. If all AI fails, you still need to document. AI augments, doesn't replace.
