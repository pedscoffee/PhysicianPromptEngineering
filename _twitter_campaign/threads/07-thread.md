TWEET 1/7:
EMR templates vs AI prompts: both save time, but they work fundamentally differently. Here's what you need to know. 🧵

---

TWEET 2/7:
Templates: Pre-written text with fill-in-the-blanks. Fast but rigid. Forces patients into predetermined boxes.

---

TWEET 3/7:
Templates create cookie-cutter notes. "Patient counseled on diet and exercise" appears regardless of actual counseling depth.

---

TWEET 4/7:
AI prompts: Flexible frameworks that adapt to each patient. Same prompt generates different notes based on clinical details provided.

---

TWEET 5/7:
AI captures nuance: "72-year-old with insulin-dependent diabetes" gets different education documentation than "28-year-old newly diagnosed type 2."

---

TWEET 6/7:
Best approach: Use templates for truly standard elements (ROS checkboxes, vitals). Use AI for narrative sections that require clinical thought.

---

TWEET 7/7:
Templates optimize for speed. AI optimizes for accuracy and personalization. Your workflow probably needs both.
