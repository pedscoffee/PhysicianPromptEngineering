TWEET 1/6:
Few-shot learning sounds technical but it's simple: show AI examples of what you want, and it learns your style. Here's how to use it for medical documentation. 🧵

TWEET 2/6:
Take 3 of your best notes for the same visit type. They should represent your ideal documentation: thorough but concise, clear clinical reasoning.

---

TWEET 3/6:
In your prompt, include these as examples: "Here are three examples of how I document this type of visit: [Example 1] [Example 2] [Example 3]"

TWEET 4/6:
AI learns patterns from your examples: your preferred structure, level of detail, terminology, tone, even how you phrase assessments and plans.

---

TWEET 5/6:
The more consistent your examples, the more consistent your AI output. Garbage in, garbage out applies to medical prompts.

TWEET 6/6:
Update your examples quarterly. As your documentation evolves, your training examples should too. Living prompts, not static ones.
