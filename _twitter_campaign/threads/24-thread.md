TWEET 1/8:
AI documentation only helps if it fits your actual workflow. Here's how to integrate it seamlessly. 🧵

---

TWEET 2/8:
During visit: Jot brief notes (chief complaint, key findings, plan). Don't try to document perfectly while with patient.

---

TWEET 3/8:
Between patients: 2-3 minutes to feed notes to AI, generate draft. Review while details are fresh.

---

TWEET 4/8:
Edit in EMR: Copy AI draft, paste into EMR, edit for accuracy and personalization. Your clinical judgment throughout.

---

TWEET 5/8:
Sign note: Final review before signing. Never sign without reading completely. AI is draft, not finished product.

---

TWEET 6/8:
Alternative workflow: Dictate during visit, AI formats dictation into structured note. Works for some, not others.

---

TWEET 7/8:
End of day: If any notes incomplete, use AI for catch-up. But goal is real-time documentation.

---

TWEET 8/8:
Find your rhythm: Some physicians batch AI documentation, others do it per-patient. Experiment to find what works.
