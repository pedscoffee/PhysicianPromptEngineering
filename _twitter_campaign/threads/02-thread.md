TWEET 4/8:
Element 4: Format requirements. "Use SOAP format. HPI should be 3-5 sentences. Include pertinent positives and negatives."

---

TWEET 5/8:
Element 5: Examples (few-shot learning). Paste 2-3 of your actual notes as examples. "Here are examples of my documentation style: [examples]"

---

TWEET 6/8:
