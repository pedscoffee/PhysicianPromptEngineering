TWEET 1/7:
"AI saves time" is vague. Here's how to measure your actual time savings with data, not feelings. 🧵

---

TWEET 2/7:
Week 0 (baseline): Time yourself on 20 consecutive notes. Average time per note. Track: simple, moderate, complex visits separately.

---

TWEET 3/7:
Week 1-2 (learning): Start using AI. Expect no time savings initially. You're learning. Track time anyway to see the learning curve.

---

TWEET 4/7:
Week 3-4 (optimization): Refine prompts. Time another 20 notes with AI assistance. Compare to baseline. Calculate per-note time savings.

---

TWEET 5/7:
Multiply per-note savings by daily visit volume. That's your daily time reclaimed. Multiply by work days per year for annual impact.

---

TWEET 6/7:
Track secondary metrics: charts completed same day, work-from-home hours, weekend catch-up sessions. These reveal quality of life improvements.

---

TWEET 7/7:
Share your data with leadership when requesting institutional AI support. "I saved 90 hours this quarter" is more compelling than "AI is helpful."
