TWEET 2/7:
Day 1: Pick ONE note type you write frequently. Annual physicals, follow-ups, or sick visits. Don't try to automate everything at once.

---

TWEET 3/7:
Day 2: Find 3 examples of your best notes for that visit type. These become your training examples. Quality matters more than quantity.

---

TWEET 4/7:
Day 3: Write a simple prompt: "You are a [specialty] physician. Generate a [note type] for a patient with [common presentation]."

---

TWEET 5/7:
Day 4: Test the prompt on a closed chart. Compare AI output to your original note. What's missing? What's wrong? Take notes.

---

TWEET 6/7:
Day 5: Refine your prompt based on testing. Add specifics about format, required elements, and your documentation style.

---

TWEET 7/7:
Day 6-7: Use the prompt on real work (de-identified). Time yourself. Track satisfaction. Iterate. You're now doing AI documentation.
