Emergency physician, busy Level 1 trauma center:

Before: 4-6 hour charting sessions after every shift, medical-legal anxiety about missed documentation

After: Developed EM-specific prompts emphasizing decision-making and disposition reasoning

Result: Charts done within 2 hours of shift end, better medical-legal documentation, actually sleeping after night shifts #MedTwitter
