Outpatient psychiatrist:

Before: Detailed mental status exams and risk assessments taking 15-20 min per note

After: Structured prompts for MSE, safety planning, medication trials, maintaining narrative quality

Result: 8-10 minute notes with better consistency, more thorough risk documentation, reduced anxiety about missed details #MedTwitter
