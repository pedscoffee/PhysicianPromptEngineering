Outpatient internist, complex patient panel:

Before: Overwhelmed by polypharmacy and comorbidities, notes taking 20+ minutes, always behind

After: Built prompts for complex medication reconciliation and multi-problem visits

Result: Better documentation of clinical reasoning, improved billing capture (more 99215s appropriately), time savings of 10 hours/week #MedTwitter
