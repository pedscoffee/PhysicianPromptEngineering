Rheumatologist, academic practice:

Before: New patient evaluations taking 45+ minutes to document, complex medication management overwhelming

After: Disease-specific prompts (RA, lupus, vasculitis), immunosuppression monitoring templates

Result: New patient notes done in 20 minutes, better capture of disease activity measures, improved quality metric documentation #MedTwitter
