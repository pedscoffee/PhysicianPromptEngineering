Academic hospitalist, teaching service:

Before: Daily progress notes taking 15-20 min each, resident supervision suffered, falling behind on rounds

After: Created specialty-specific prompts for common admissions (CHF, COPD, pneumonia), taught residents the same approach

Result: Notes down to 8-10 minutes, more time teaching, residents finishing their notes faster too #MedTwitter
