Urgent care physician, multiple locations:

Before: High patient volume, simple visits still needed complete documentation, always behind

After: Chief complaint-based prompts (URI, laceration, sprain, UTI), quick but thorough templates

Result: Seeing 25-30 patients per shift with real-time documentation, charts closed before leaving, sustainable pace #MedTwitter
