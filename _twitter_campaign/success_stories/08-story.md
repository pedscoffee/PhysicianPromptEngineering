Interventional cardiologist:

Before: Procedure notes and complex follow-ups overwhelming, dictation taking hours

After: Prompts for common procedures, post-cath notes, heart failure management

Result: Procedure documentation time cut in half, better template for trainees, more time for complex clinical thinking #MedTwitter
