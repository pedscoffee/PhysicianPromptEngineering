Pediatrician, solo private practice:

Before: Well-child visits backed up documentation all day, staying late every evening

After: Created age-specific templates with developmental milestones and anticipatory guidance, AI fills in patient-specific details

Result: Real-time documentation during clinic, left office on time, better parent education materials #MedTwitter
