Dermatologist, high-volume practice:

Before: 30-40 patients daily, documentation taking 3-4 hours after clinic

After: Prompts for common presentations (acne, eczema, skin checks), lesion documentation templates

Result: Real-time charting during rooming, clinic day ends when last patient leaves, improved quality of life #MedTwitter
