OB/GYN, busy clinic and hospital practice:

Before: Weekend catch-up sessions routine, prenatal visits and procedures creating documentation backlog

After: Separate prompts for OB visits by trimester, GYN procedures, annual exams

Result: Eliminated weekend work, improved prenatal counseling documentation, better work-life balance with young kids at home #MedTwitter
