Palliative care physician:

Before: Emotionally exhausting conversations, then hours documenting goals-of-care discussions

After: Structured but sensitive prompts for advance care planning, symptom management, family meetings

Result: Better documentation of nuanced conversations, less emotional depletion from redundant charting, energy preserved for patient care #MedTwitter
