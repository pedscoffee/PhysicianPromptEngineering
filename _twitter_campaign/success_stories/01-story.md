Family medicine physician, 15 years in practice:

Before: 2-3 hours nightly documentation, missing family dinners, considered leaving medicine

After: Implemented AI prompts for common visit types, focused on annual physicals and chronic disease follow-ups

Result: Down to 30 minutes daily catch-up, home by 6pm most nights, rediscovered why I became a doctor #MedTwitter
