Nephrologist, hospital and clinic:

Before: Complex CKD staging, dialysis access planning, extensive lab review creating hours of documentation

After: CKD stage-based prompts, dialysis planning templates, transplant evaluation structures

Result: Hospital rounds completed by noon instead of 2pm, more time for patient education, better documentation of shared decision-making #MedTwitter
