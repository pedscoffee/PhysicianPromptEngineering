Eighty days of this journey. Ten days left in the reflection series.

Looking back at reflection one, I barely recognize where we were. The community was a handful of people. The tools were rough. I wasn't sure this would go anywhere beyond personal use.

Now there are physicians using these tools across dozens of countries and specialties. The community solves problems together. People are building extensions and improvements I never imagined. This thing has life beyond me.

The last ten reflections feel significant. Wrap-up time. But also continuation time—this project doesn't end when the reflection series does. This is a checkpoint, not a destination.

Ten more days. Then we keep building. The work continues. The community grows. The mission persists. Together, we're changing what it means to be a physician in the age of AI.
