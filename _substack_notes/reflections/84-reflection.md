This project looks nothing like what I originally envisioned.

I thought I'd build a few personal prompts and maybe share them on Reddit. Now it's a full framework with documentation, community support, educational resources, multiple contributors, and international reach.

I could be frustrated that it didn't follow my plan. Instead I'm amazed that it grew beyond my plan. The community shaped this into something better than my original vision. Every deviation from the plan was actually an improvement.

This is the magic of open source. You build something small and practical. Other people see potential you missed. They add ideas and energy. The project evolves into something that serves the community's needs rather than just the founder's vision.

Let go of the plan. Trust the process. Be amazed by what emerges. That's the journey I'm on.
