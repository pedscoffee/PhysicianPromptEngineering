Healthcare bureaucracy wasn't designed by physicians, and it shows.

Every layer of documentation requirements comes from administrators trying to satisfy billing departments trying to satisfy insurance companies trying to minimize payouts. Physicians are at the bottom of that chain, drowning in requirements that often have nothing to do with patient care.

I can't fix the bureaucracy. I'm just one physician with a GitHub repository.

But I can build tools that make the bureaucracy less soul-crushing. I can help physicians reclaim their time even if I can't eliminate the requirements. Small rebellion, but it's what I've got.

Sometimes that feels like not enough. Today it feels like exactly enough.
