People keep asking if I'll monetize this project.

I could. Freemium model. Premium features. Subscription tiers. Consulting services. The venture capital playbook is well-established. I'd probably get funding if I pitched it right.

But then what? Suddenly I'm optimizing for growth metrics instead of physician wellbeing. I'm beholden to investors instead of the community. I'm building a business instead of a movement.

I'm not saying monetization is inherently wrong. People deserve to be paid for their work. But I'm deeply skeptical of profit motives in healthcare. Too many "solutions" that optimized for revenue instead of outcomes.

For now, this stays free and open. Maybe that's naive. Maybe it's unsustainable. But it feels right. And that matters.
