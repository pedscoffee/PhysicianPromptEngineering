Had a patient today who reminded me why documentation shouldn't consume our lives.

Eight-year-old with asthma. Scared, wheezing, eyes wide. Mom anxious. I sat with them, explained everything, showed the child how the inhaler works with a spacer, made it a game. Saw the fear ease. Heard the breathing improve. Felt that connection that makes medicine meaningful.

That visit took fifteen minutes. The documentation took eight. Something is deeply wrong with that ratio.

This is why I build. So physicians can spend fifteen minutes connecting with scared kids and only two minutes documenting it. So the medicine is the medicine, not the paperwork.

Never forget why we're here.
