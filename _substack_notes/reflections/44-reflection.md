These tools won't solve everything. Let me be clear about that.

They won't fix broken healthcare systems. They won't eliminate administrative burden. They won't prevent burnout on their own. They won't make bad EHRs good. They won't change insurance company practices.

What they can do is reclaim some time. Make documentation less soul-crushing. Give physicians more energy for the parts of medicine that matter. That's significant, but it's not a cure-all.

I'm trying to be honest about limitations. Overselling helps no one. These are useful tools with real benefits and real constraints. Set your expectations accordingly, and you won't be disappointed.
