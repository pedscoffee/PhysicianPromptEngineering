I want to thank some people specifically.

The emergency physician who tested every single prompt in her overnight shifts and sent detailed feedback. The retired doctor who copyedited all the documentation. The medical student who built the first video tutorials. The hospitalist who answers community questions when I'm in clinic.

This project exists because of people who give time and expertise expecting nothing in return. They do it because they believe in the mission. Because they want to help other physicians. Because they're the kind of people who see a problem and contribute to solutions.

I don't know how to thank you adequately. "Thank you" feels insufficient. But it's what I have, and I mean it deeply. You've made this project better than I could have made it alone. You've made this community real.

Thank you. For everything.
