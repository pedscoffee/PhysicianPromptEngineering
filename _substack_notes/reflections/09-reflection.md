Small wins feel huge when you're building something from scratch.

Today someone created their first custom prompt using the framework. They posted it in the community and other physicians started adapting it for their specialties. Watching that organic collaboration happen—physicians helping physicians—made my entire week.

This is what I hoped for but didn't dare expect. Not just people using tools, but people making them their own. Modifying them. Sharing improvements. Building a collective knowledge base.

We're not just solving documentation burden. We're building a community of physician-innovators. And that's somehow even better than I imagined.
