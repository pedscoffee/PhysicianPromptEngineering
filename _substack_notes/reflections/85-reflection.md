A computer science student pointed out a more efficient way to structure one of my functions.

She was right. Her approach was cleaner, faster, more elegant. I'd been doing it the hard way because I didn't know better. She explained the concept patiently, like I was the student—because I was.

This is humbling work. There's always someone who knows more. Always a better way to do things. Always something new to learn. And that's good. That's how we improve.

The best communities are mutual learning spaces. I teach physicians about prompt engineering. Developers teach me about code. Physicians teach each other about specialty-specific needs. Everyone has expertise to share and gaps to fill.

We're all students and teachers simultaneously. That's how knowledge grows. That's how projects improve. Stay humble. Stay curious. Keep learning from everyone.
