A medical school reached out asking to include this in their clinical informatics curriculum.

I had to read the email three times to believe it. An actual institution, teaching actual medical students, wanting to use tools I built in my kitchen. Tools that started as my personal solution to my personal burnout.

Part of me is thrilled. This is validation that the work matters. It's a path to reaching new physicians early, before documentation burden crushes them.

Another part of me is terrified. What if my tools aren't ready for curriculum use? What if I teach students bad habits? What if the academic scrutiny reveals that this is all held together with coffee and determination?

But I said yes. Because perfect is the enemy of good, and students deserve these skills.
