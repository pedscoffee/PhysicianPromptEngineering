Data security keeps me up at night.

Physicians are entering clinical information into these tools. Even though I never see it, even though it's processed locally or through secure APIs, the responsibility is heavy. One security breach could compromise patient privacy and destroy physician trust.

I'm not a security expert. I'm a pediatrician who learned to code. So I'm constantly learning, constantly reviewing security best practices, constantly paranoid about vulnerabilities.

This is another argument for keeping things simple. Every feature is a potential security risk. Every integration is a potential vulnerability. Minimal complexity means minimal attack surface.

Will this project ever be perfectly secure? Probably not. But I can make it as secure as I know how, document the risks clearly, and keep learning. That's the best I can offer, and hopefully it's enough.
