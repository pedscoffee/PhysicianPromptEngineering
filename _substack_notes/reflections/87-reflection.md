Was it worth it? The late nights, the sacrificed weekends, the exhaustion?

I think about the physician who told me she's staying in medicine because these tools made it bearable. I think about the resident who's learning to use AI thoughtfully instead of fearfully. I think about the community that formed around shared purpose.

Yeah. It was worth it.

Not every moment felt worth it. Not every sacrifice was easy. Not every hour of work had clear value. But in aggregate, looking at what's been built and who's been helped... worth it.

I don't know if I'd make the same choices if I started over. I'm not sure I'd recommend this path to others. It's been hard in ways I didn't anticipate. But I'm grateful for what it became.

Worth it. Definitely worth it.
