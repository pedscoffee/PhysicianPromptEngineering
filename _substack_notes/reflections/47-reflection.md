How do I measure success for this project?

GitHub stars are nice but meaningless. Download numbers tell me nothing about impact. Even user count is just vanity if the tools aren't actually helping.

The metrics that matter: Time saved. Physicians staying in practice. Reduced stress. Improved work-life balance. More time with patients. Fewer notes finished at midnight.

These are harder to measure. They require follow-up surveys, qualitative feedback, long-term tracking. But they're the real indicators of whether this project is succeeding at its mission.

I'm working on better measurement systems. Because if we can prove these tools reduce burnout, that's data we can use to advocate for broader adoption. Evidence matters in medicine. It should matter here too.
