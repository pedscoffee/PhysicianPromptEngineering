A patient asked me today if I was typing during our visit.

I wasn't—I use the prompts after the visit, not during. But her question revealed something important. Patients notice when we're distracted by documentation. They notice when we're looking at screens instead of faces.

Documentation burden doesn't just hurt physicians. It hurts the patient-physician relationship. Every moment I spend typing is a moment I'm not fully present with the person in front of me.

This is what we're fighting for: presence. Connection. The space to be fully human with another human who needs care.

When I forget why this matters, I think about that patient's question. I think about being the kind of physician who makes eye contact, not keyboard contact.
