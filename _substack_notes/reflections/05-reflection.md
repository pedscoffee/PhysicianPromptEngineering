I'll be honest—last night I wondered if anyone actually needs this.

The self-doubt comes in waves. Maybe physicians are fine with the status quo. Maybe I'm building something only I want. Maybe this is just my weird obsession with optimization and automation.

Then morning comes, and there are three new messages from physicians asking questions, suggesting features, sharing their wins. The doubt fades. Not because I'm suddenly confident, but because the community reminds me this matters to more than just me.

Building in public means the vulnerable moments are visible too. This is one of them. Tomorrow will be better.
