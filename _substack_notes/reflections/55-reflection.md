I got messages this week from physicians in five countries.

Australia. Canada. UK. India. South Africa. All dealing with documentation burden. All looking for solutions. All finding their way to this little open source project built by a burned-out pediatrician in the US.

Healthcare systems differ wildly across countries. But documentation burden is apparently universal. The details vary—different EHRs, different regulations, different workflows—but the core problem is the same. Physicians spend too much time documenting and not enough time doctoring.

That global resonance is both humbling and motivating. We're not just solving an American problem. We're addressing something fundamental about modern medicine. The solutions we build here can help physicians everywhere.

The internet makes that possible. Open source makes it accessible. Community makes it real.
