Why open source? People ask me this all the time.

The answer is simple: because our medical records aren't open. Because EHR systems are black boxes. Because physicians have lost control of our own workflows.

Open source is my small rebellion against a system that tells doctors "you'll use what we give you and you'll like it." It's saying: here are the tools, here's how they work, modify them if you want, share them if they help.

I've seen what happens when corporations control physician tools. They optimize for profit, not for physician wellbeing. This project is my bet that physicians, given the right tools and transparency, can build something better together.
