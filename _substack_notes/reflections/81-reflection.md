I made a big mistake today. Deleted a branch with uncommitted work. Hours of prompt refinement—gone.

Just sat there staring at the screen. No backup. No git safety net. Just... gone.

Eventually I started over. Rebuilt what I remembered. Some pieces came back better the second time. Some were lost forever. It hurt, but it wasn't fatal.

This is what building looks like sometimes. Stupid mistakes. Preventable losses. Moments of sheer frustration at your own carelessness. But you get up. You rebuild. You implement better backup systems. You learn.

The work that survives your own mistakes is the work that was meant to survive. Everything else is practice. Expensive practice, but practice nonetheless. Tomorrow I'll be a developer who backs up his work. Today I'm a cautionary tale.

Live and learn. Or in this case, lose and learn.
