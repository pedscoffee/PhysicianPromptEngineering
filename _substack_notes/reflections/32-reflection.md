Every prompt goes through dozens of iterations before I share it publicly.

Test with simple cases. Test with complex cases. Test with edge cases. Test with different specialties. Test when I'm fresh. Test when I'm exhausted (because that's when physicians will actually use it).

Does it produce consistent results? Does it handle missing information gracefully? Does it fail safely when it fails? Is it actually faster than typing from scratch?

This testing phase is tedious. But it's essential. Because when a physician trusts these tools with their workflow, they need to work. Every time. Not just in ideal conditions, but in the chaos of real practice.

Quality isn't optional. It's respect.
