People ask how this compares to [corporate AI scribe product].

Honest answer? Their tool is probably more polished. Better UI. Smoother integration. Dedicated support team. All the things you get with venture capital funding.

But here's what they don't have: physician control. Open source code. Privacy guarantees. No subscription lock-in. Community ownership. Customization freedom.

I'm not trying to build a prettier corporate product. I'm trying to build a different kind of tool entirely. One that physicians own and control. That might mean less polish. But it also means more autonomy.

Different goals. Different values. Different futures. Choose the one that aligns with who you want to be as a physician.
