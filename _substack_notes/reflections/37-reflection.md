Got a detailed feedback email today that fundamentally changed my roadmap.

A hospitalist pointed out that the discharge summary prompt was optimized for straightforward cases but broke down with complex patients who had multiple comorbidities and complicated hospital courses. She was right. I'd built it based on my pediatric experience—simpler cases, different workflow.

This is exactly why I need diverse physician input. My blind spots are huge. My assumptions are specialty-specific. Every piece of feedback reveals something I missed.

Roadmap revised. Discharge summary prompt getting a complete overhaul. Better late than never. Better to build it right than to build it fast.
