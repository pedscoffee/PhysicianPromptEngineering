I need to say thank you.

To the physicians who trusted these tools when they were rough. To the early contributors who improved the prompts. To everyone who's shared feedback, reported bugs, suggested features. To the community members who help each other when I'm in clinic and can't respond immediately.

This project exists because of you. Not just in a feel-good way, but literally. Your testing found the bugs. Your feedback shaped the features. Your success stories keep me motivated. Your patience with my learning curve made this possible.

Building alone would have been faster. Building together has been infinitely better. Thank you for taking this journey with me.
