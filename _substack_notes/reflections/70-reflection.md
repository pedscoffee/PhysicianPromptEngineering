Everyone wants EHR integration. I understand why—it would be so much smoother.

But EHR integration means dealing with corporate IT departments, compliance reviews, security audits, legal agreements. It means each hospital system needs separate implementation. It means updating when EHRs update. It means the project becomes about integration instead of prompts.

I'm staying focused on what I can control: excellent prompts that work with any EHR through copy-paste. It's clunkier than direct integration. But it's universal. It works today. It doesn't require institutional buy-in.

Sometimes the scrappy solution is the right solution. Not because it's perfect, but because it's accessible. Perfect integration that takes three years and only works at five hospitals helps fewer physicians than good-enough copy-paste that works everywhere now.

Pragmatism over perfection. Again and always.
