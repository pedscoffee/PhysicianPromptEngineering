I remember the exact moment I realized documentation had broken me.

End of a long week. I'd seen forty-something patients, had great clinical interactions, made a few diagnoses I was proud of. Drove home feeling good. Then sat down to finish notes and... couldn't. Just stared at the screen. The cursor blinked. My brain had nothing left.

Called in sick the next day. Not because I was physically ill, but because I couldn't face more documentation. That's when I knew something had to change.

If you're reading this and you've been there—you're not weak. You're not a bad doctor. The system is broken, not you. We're going to fix this together.
