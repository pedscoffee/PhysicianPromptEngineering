Medicine and technology should be partners, not adversaries.

But somewhere along the way, we started seeing tech as something imposed on us rather than something we could shape. EHR implementation meetings where physicians nod along to workflows designed by people who have never seen a patient.

I dream of a different future. One where physicians learn basic prompt engineering the way we learn basic statistics. Where we're not just users of AI tools, but shapers of them. Where the people solving clinical problems with technology are the same people living those problems every day.

That's the intersection I'm trying to build toward.
