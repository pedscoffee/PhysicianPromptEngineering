I broke the main branch last week.

Pushed an update that had a critical bug. For four hours, the documentation generator wasn't working. I got panicked messages from physicians who depended on it. I felt sick.

Fixed it as fast as I could. Added better testing. Wrote an apology. But mostly, I learned: when physicians trust your tools for their daily workflow, reliability isn't optional.

Real developers probably have systems that prevent this. I'm learning as I go. The community has been incredibly gracious about my learning curve. I'm trying to earn that grace by getting better every day, learning from every mistake.

Mistakes hurt less when they make you stronger.
