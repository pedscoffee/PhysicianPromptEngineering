Today I got an email from a family medicine physician in rural Montana. She said she's been using the prompts for three weeks and she's leaving work on time now. On time. For the first time in two years.

I sat at my desk and just... felt it. This is why we build.

Every email, every GitHub star, every person who takes time to share how these tools are helping—it fuels another week of development. Another late night debugging. Another round of improvements.

I'm building this for that physician in Montana. For every physician who's tired of being tired. Thank you for trusting this project with your workflows.
