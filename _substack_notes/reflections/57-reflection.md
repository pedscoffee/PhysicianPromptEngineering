A hospital system asked about institutional licensing.

They want to implement these tools across their physician network. Hundreds of doctors. Systematic deployment. Training programs. The works.

Part of me is excited. This is scale. This is impact. This could help hundreds of physicians simultaneously.

Another part is nervous. Institutional adoption could mean institutional control. Could mean they take the open source tools and close them off. Could mean physicians lose ownership.

I'm navigating carefully. Yes to helping them implement. No to exclusive licensing. The tools stay open source regardless of who uses them. Institutions can adopt, but they can't own.

This balance between growth and values is delicate. But it's essential to get right.
