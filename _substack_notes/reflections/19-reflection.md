What keeps me motivated? Honestly, anger.

Not destructive anger. Productive anger. Anger that physicians are burning out over documentation. Anger that we've normalized spending more time on computers than with patients. Anger that the solutions offered to us usually make things worse, not better.

That anger is fuel. It gets me through the tedious debugging sessions. It powers the late nights refining prompts. It reminds me why I started when the dopamine of a new project fades.

I'm angry on behalf of every physician who's too exhausted to be angry anymore. And I'm channeling that into something useful. Something that pushes back. Something that says: we deserve better, and we can build it ourselves.
