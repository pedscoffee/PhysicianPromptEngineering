A researcher asked if they could study this project's impact on physician burnout.

Actual research. With measures and controls and statistical analysis. The kind of evidence that could demonstrate whether these tools actually reduce burnout or just feel like they do.

I said yes immediately. Then felt nervous. What if the research shows minimal impact? What if the tools don't actually reduce burnout when measured rigorously? What if I've been building on wishful thinking?

But that's exactly why research matters. Anecdotes and testimonials are nice, but they're not evidence. If these tools truly help, research will show it. If they don't, I need to know that so I can build something better.

Physician-led innovation needs to be evidence-based innovation. Otherwise we're no better than the vendors selling solutions based on marketing hype. Time to put up or shut up.
