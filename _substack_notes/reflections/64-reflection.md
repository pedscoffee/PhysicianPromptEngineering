A physician asked about liability: "If I use AI for documentation and there's an error, am I responsible?"

Yes. Absolutely yes. You're always responsible for your documentation, regardless of what tools you use.

This isn't a technicality—it's fundamental. These tools assist; they don't replace physician judgment. You review every output. You verify accuracy. You take ownership of what goes in the medical record.

I make this very clear in documentation. No disclaimers buried in fine print—right up front, in plain language. You're the physician. You're accountable. The AI is just a word processor with extra features.

Anyone looking for a tool to blindly generate notes without review should look elsewhere. That's not what this is, and it never will be.
