Debugging is humbling work.

You think you understand how something works. You write code that should, logically, function perfectly. Then reality laughs at you. The prompt produces inconsistent results. The formatting breaks. The edge case you didn't consider becomes the use case that breaks everything.

Last night I spent three hours tracking down a bug that turned out to be a single misplaced quotation mark. Three hours. For one character.

But here's the thing: every bug fixed makes the tools more reliable. Every edge case handled makes them more robust. Every hour of frustrated debugging is an hour physicians won't have to spend troubleshooting later.

My frustration today is their smooth experience tomorrow.
