I spent eight hours this week just writing documentation. Not code—documentation.

How to install. How to customize. How to troubleshoot. What each parameter does. Why design decisions were made. Common mistakes and how to avoid them.

It felt like a waste of time when I could have been building features. Then I got a message from a physician who successfully implemented the tools without needing to ask me questions. Just followed the documentation start to finish.

That's when I understood: documentation is force multiplication. Every hour I spend writing clear docs is saved a hundred times over by physicians who can self-serve. It's teaching that scales infinitely.

Good documentation is a love letter to future users. It says: I respect your time enough to explain this clearly. That respect is repaid in adoption and trust.
