Documentation isn't just tedious—it's a major driver of physician burnout.

I've watched colleagues leave medicine. Not because they stopped caring about patients, but because the administrative burden crushed their spirit. The talented physician who switched to telemedicine because at least that has less documentation. The brilliant hospitalist who went part-time just to survive.

We're losing good doctors to paperwork.

If this project saves even one physician from leaving medicine, if it gives even one person their evenings back, if it prevents even one case of burnout... then every hour I've spent building this matters.

This is healthcare prevention work. Just for physicians instead of patients.
