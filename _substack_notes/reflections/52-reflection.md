Not every physician has equal access to these tools. That bothers me.

You need decent internet. You need some technical literacy. You need time to learn the system. You need to work in an environment that allows AI tools. Those requirements exclude physicians in under-resourced settings, older physicians less comfortable with technology, anyone in restrictive institutional environments.

I'm trying to lower these barriers. Better documentation. Video tutorials. Offline options. Simplified interfaces. But I'm one person with limited time. And I worry that the physicians who need these tools most—the ones most crushed by documentation burden—might be the ones least able to access them.

This is a problem I don't have great answers for yet. But naming it is the first step toward solving it.
