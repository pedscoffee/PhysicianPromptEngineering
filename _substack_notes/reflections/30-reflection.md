Thirty days of reflections. Thirty days of building. Thirty days of this community growing.

When I started this project, I hoped maybe a handful of physicians would find it useful. Now we have physicians from dozens of specialties using these tools daily. The GitHub repository has more stars than I dared imagine. The community discussions are rich and thoughtful.

But the best part isn't the metrics. It's the messages from physicians saying they're remembering why they loved medicine. That the documentation burden is lifting. That they're staying in practice because these tools make it bearable.

This is just the beginning. There's so much more to build. But today, I'm taking a moment to appreciate how far we've come together.
