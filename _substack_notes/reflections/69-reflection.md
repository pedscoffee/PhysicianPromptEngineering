Residents are the fastest adopters of these tools. Makes sense—they're the most crushed by documentation.

I've been thinking about how to serve them specifically. They face unique constraints: teaching requirements, supervision structures, learning workflows while also producing work. Their documentation needs differ from attending physicians.

A group of residents is collaborating on prompts optimized for training environments. Prompts that help them learn clinical reasoning while also being efficient. Templates that satisfy teaching requirements without creating extra work.

This next generation of physicians is going to shape how AI gets used in medicine. If we can give them good tools and good training early, they'll build better practices. They'll demand better systems. They won't accept documentation burden as inevitable.

The future is being built by tired residents at 2 AM. Let's give them better tools.
