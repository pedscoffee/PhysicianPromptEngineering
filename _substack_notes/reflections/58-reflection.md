A resident messaged me asking how to get started building healthcare tools.

She's interested in physician-developer work. Wants to solve problems she sees in her training. Looking for guidance on where to start, how to learn, what's worth building.

I spent an hour on the phone with her. Shared resources. Talked through her ideas. Encouraged her ambitions. Because this is how the movement grows—not just through tools, but through people. Every physician who learns to build solutions is multiplying the impact.

Maybe she'll build something that makes this project obsolete. That would be perfect. That would mean we've succeeded in empowering physicians to solve their own problems.

Legacy isn't about my tools lasting forever. It's about inspiring others to build.
