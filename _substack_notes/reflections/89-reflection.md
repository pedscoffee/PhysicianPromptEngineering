One more reflection after this. Day ninety tomorrow.

I thought I'd have some grand conclusion by now. Some perfect summation of the journey. But mostly I just feel... grateful. Tired but grateful. Proud of what we've built. Excited for what comes next.

This reflection series was supposed to humanize the project. To show the person behind the code. The physician behind the prompts. I hope it worked. I hope it made this feel real and personal and honest.

Because it is. This isn't a corporation or a startup. It's a physician trying to help other physicians. That's all it ever was. That's all it needs to be.

Tomorrow's reflection will be the last in this series. But it won't be the last reflection. The work continues. The journey goes on. The mission persists.

See you on day ninety.
