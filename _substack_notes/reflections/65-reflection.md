I almost added a feature today that would have been terrible.

Someone requested it. It sounded cool. I started coding. Got halfway through before I realized: this makes the tool more complex without making it more useful. Feature creep disguised as improvement.

There's this temptation to keep adding features. More options. More customization. More everything. But every feature adds complexity. Every option is a decision point. More isn't always better.

The best tools do one thing extremely well. They're simple to understand and reliable in practice. That's harder than building complicated tools with dozens of features that half-work.

I deleted the half-finished code. Thanked the person for the suggestion. Explained why I'm not implementing it. Stayed focused on the core mission: reducing documentation burden simply and effectively.
