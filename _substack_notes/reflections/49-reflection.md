We got our first code contribution from someone I've never met.

A physician in Australia modified one of the prompts for their emergency department workflow and submitted a pull request. Clean code. Good documentation. Ready to merge.

This is the moment I've been hoping for. When the project grows beyond me. When other physicians start contributing their expertise. When it becomes truly community-driven instead of founder-driven.

One contribution might seem small. But it's proof of concept. It shows this can scale beyond my limited time and perspective. Other physicians can improve these tools. The community can build itself.

This is what sustainable looks like. And it just took its first step.
