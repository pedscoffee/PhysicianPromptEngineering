Can I maintain this project long-term? I don't know yet.

The honest truth is this is currently unsustainable. I'm one person. I have a clinical job. I have a life outside medicine (theoretically). Something has to give eventually.

But I'm committed to finding a model that works. Maybe it's growing the contributor base. Maybe it's eventually finding non-profit funding. Maybe it's building the community strong enough that it can sustain itself.

What I won't do is sell out to a corporation or let this become another abandoned open source project. Physicians are trusting these tools with their workflows. That trust comes with responsibility. I'm figuring out how to honor it sustainably, but I will figure it out.
