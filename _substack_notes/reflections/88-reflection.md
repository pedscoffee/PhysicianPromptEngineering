If I could go back and give myself advice at the start:

Ship earlier. Don't wait for perfect. Release rough versions and iterate based on real feedback.

Document everything. Future you will thank past you. So will every user who comes after.

Build community first, features second. Engaged users will tell you what to build. Isolated development leads to tools nobody wants.

Stay focused. Every tangent is a distraction from the core mission. Say no more than you say yes.

Take care of yourself. Burned out founders abandon projects. Sustainable pace beats heroic sprints.

Trust the process. The path won't look like you expected, and that's okay. The destination matters more than the route.

I probably wouldn't have listened. Sometimes you have to learn by doing. But maybe someone reading this will save themselves some pain.
