Some physicians won't try these tools no matter how much evidence I provide.

That used to frustrate me. I'd think: if you're suffering, and there's a solution, why not try it? But I'm learning that change is hard. Trust is hard. Adopting new workflows when you're already overwhelmed is hard.

Some people need to see colleagues succeed before they'll try. Some need institutional endorsement. Some need more time. And some will never adopt, and that's okay too.

I can't force change. I can only build good tools, document them clearly, support the early adopters, and let the results speak. The physicians who are ready will find their way here. The ones who aren't won't, and maybe they have good reasons.

Meet people where they are. That's true for patients and for physician colleagues.
