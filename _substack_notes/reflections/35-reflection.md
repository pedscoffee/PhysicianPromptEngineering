The best marketing is physicians telling other physicians.

I've never spent money on advertising. Never hired a marketing team. Never even had a proper launch announcement. Every person who finds these tools finds them through another physician saying "this helped me, maybe it'll help you."

That word-of-mouth growth is slower than paid marketing. But it's real. When a colleague recommends a tool, you trust it differently than when a company sells it to you. You know they're sharing because it genuinely helped, not because they're getting a commission.

This slow, organic growth feels right. We're building trust one physician at a time. That's a foundation I'm comfortable building on.
