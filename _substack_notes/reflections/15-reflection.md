Feature requests are a gift, even when I can't implement them all.

Every request tells me how physicians are using the tools. What workflows matter. What pain points I haven't addressed. Sometimes the request reveals a use case I never imagined.

But I'm one person. I have to prioritize. That means saying "not yet" more often than "yes." It means building the features that help the most physicians instead of the perfect solution for one specialty.

This is where the open source model shines. Someone asked for a dermatology-specific prompt template. Before I could build it, two dermatologists in the community collaborated and shared their version. Problem solved faster than I could have solved it alone.
