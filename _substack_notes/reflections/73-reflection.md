Am I a physician who codes or a developer who practices medicine?

Some days I feel like an imposter in both worlds. Not physician enough for medical colleagues who think this tech stuff is a distraction. Not developer enough for tech people who see my amateur code.

But maybe that in-between space is exactly where I need to be. The physician-developers, the clinician-technologists, the people who speak both languages—we're the bridges. We translate clinical needs into technical requirements. We build tools that actually solve real problems because we live those problems.

Imposter syndrome is just fear of not fitting neatly into existing categories. But the most interesting work happens at the intersections. I'm learning to embrace the hyphenate identity. Physician-developer. Both. Neither. Something new.

The discomfort means I'm doing something that doesn't quite exist yet. That's okay. That might even be the point.
