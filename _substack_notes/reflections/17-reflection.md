I have this vision that probably sounds naive.

Five years from now, I imagine a medical student's orientation including a session on prompt engineering. Not as a tech novelty, but as a fundamental skill. Like learning to present a case or write orders.

I imagine hospitals having repositories of physician-developed prompts, shared and refined by their own doctors. I imagine specialty societies maintaining prompt libraries as continuing education resources.

I imagine physicians being empowered instead of overwhelmed by AI.

Maybe it's naive. But someone has to believe in a better future before it can exist. Today, that someone is me. Tomorrow, maybe it's us.
