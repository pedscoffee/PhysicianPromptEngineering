The irony isn't lost on me: I'm building burnout prevention tools while probably burning myself out.

I preach work-life balance while coding at midnight. I advocate for physician wellbeing while skipping meals to debug. I talk about sustainable practice while maintaining an unsustainable development schedule.

Do as I say, not as I do? That doesn't feel right.

Maybe the answer is that this is a sprint, not a marathon. Get the foundation built, grow the community, distribute the work. Then step back to something more sustainable. That's the plan anyway.

Or maybe I'm just rationalizing. Hard to have perspective when you're in it. But I'm trying to stay aware of the contradiction. That's got to count for something.
