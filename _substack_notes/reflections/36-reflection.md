I worry about AI in medicine. I really do.

Not because AI is inherently bad, but because it could so easily be weaponized against physicians. Imagine administrators using AI to increase patient loads because "documentation is automated now." Imagine insurance companies using AI-generated notes to find reasons to deny care.

This project tries to put AI in physicians' hands before someone else uses it against us. To make it a tool for our autonomy, not another mechanism of control.

But I'm constantly asking myself: am I helping? Or am I just making it easier for healthcare systems to extract more from already exhausted physicians? That ethical tension doesn't have easy answers, but it needs to be part of the conversation.
