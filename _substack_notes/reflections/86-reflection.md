Where will this project be in five years? I let myself dream.

Maybe medical schools teach prompt engineering as a core skill. Maybe every hospital has a physician-led AI tools committee. Maybe there are specialty-specific prompt libraries maintained by professional societies. Maybe documentation burden has actually decreased because physicians took control of the solutions.

Maybe this specific project is obsolete because something better came along. That would be perfect. I don't need this to last forever. I need this to prove that physician-led innovation works. To inspire others. To demonstrate what's possible.

Five years from now, I hope I'm one of dozens of physician-developers building tools that empower our colleagues. I hope this project is historical artifact, interesting mainly as an early example of a much larger movement.

Dream big. Build practically. Inspire others. Let the future improve on our present.
