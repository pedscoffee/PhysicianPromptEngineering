Physicians should be leading healthcare innovation, not just adapting to it.

We're the ones in the rooms with patients. We understand clinical workflows. We know what actually matters versus what looks good in a PowerPoint. But too often, we're the last people consulted when someone builds "healthcare solutions."

This project is my attempt to flip that script. Physician-designed, physician-tested, physician-refined. Every feature comes from clinical experience. Every prompt solves a real documentation problem I've lived.

Will it be as polished as a corporate product? Probably not. Will it actually solve the problems physicians face? That's the bet I'm making. And so far, the community says yes.
