Two-thirds done with this reflection series. Sixty days of building, learning, sharing.

The project has momentum now. It feels less like pushing a boulder uphill and more like steering something with its own energy. The community generates ideas. Contributors submit improvements. Physicians help each other troubleshoot.

This is what sustainable looks like. Not one person carrying everything, but many people each carrying a piece. The load distributed. The knowledge shared. The work collective.

I'm still too central to the project. That's the next challenge—distributing leadership, not just work. Building governance structures that outlast any individual contributor. Making sure this survives even if I burn out or move on.

Thirty more days. Thirty more reflections. Then we see what we've built and where we go next.
