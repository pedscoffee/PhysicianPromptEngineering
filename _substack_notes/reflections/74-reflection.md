Another physician launched a similar project this week. My first thought was: competition.

My second thought was: good. We need more people building physician-centered tools. We need more options. We need more physicians empowered to create solutions. There's way more than enough documentation burden to go around.

This isn't a zero-sum game. Someone else's project succeeding doesn't make mine less valuable. Different approaches serve different needs. Maybe their tools work better for some specialties. Maybe we can learn from each other. Maybe we can even collaborate.

Scarcity mindset says: protect your turf. Abundance mindset says: there's room for everyone, and we're all better when we share.

I'm choosing abundance. It feels better and it's truer to the open source philosophy. May a thousand physician-led solutions bloom. The more the better.
