A physician told me these tools are part of her burnout recovery plan.

She'd taken a leave of absence. Was seriously considering leaving medicine entirely. Part of her return-to-work plan, negotiated with her therapist, was using tools to reduce documentation burden. Our prompts were part of that strategy.

That email hit different. This isn't just about efficiency or convenience. For some physicians, this is about surviving in medicine. About making practice sustainable. About finding a way to keep doing the work we love without destroying ourselves.

If these tools can be part of someone's healing journey, if they can help a physician stay in practice... that's sacred work. That's worth everything.
