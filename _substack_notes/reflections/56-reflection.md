I looked at the first version of the documentation prompt today. Barely recognized it.

It was so basic. Rigid structure. No customization options. Worked okay for simple cases but fell apart with complexity. How did anyone find that useful?

But they did. Because even a rough tool is better than nothing when you're drowning in documentation. The early adopters were generous with their patience and feedback. They saw the potential through the rough edges.

Now we're on version 8. Modular. Customizable. Handles complex cases. Works across specialties. The evolution from version 1 to version 8 represents hundreds of hours of refinement and thousands of pieces of feedback.

That's what iterative development looks like. Start rough. Listen hard. Improve constantly. The journey from bad to good to great is visible in the commit history.
