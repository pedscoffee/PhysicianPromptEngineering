Version 1.0 was embarrassing. Version 2.0 was better but still rough. Version 3.0 was decent. Current version is good but not great.

This trajectory is what progress looks like. Not a perfect launch, but continuous improvement. Each version learns from physician feedback. Each iteration fixes problems the previous version revealed.

Some people wait for perfection before sharing. That's not how I work. I release early, get feedback, iterate quickly. It means the early adopters deal with more rough edges, but it also means the tools improve faster.

This philosophy applies to the whole project. It's not done. It'll never be done. There's always another improvement, another feature, another refinement. And that's exactly how it should be.
