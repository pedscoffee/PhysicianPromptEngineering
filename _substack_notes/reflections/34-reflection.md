It's 2 AM and I'm debugging a prompt formatting issue.

This is probably not healthy. I should be sleeping. I have clinic in six hours. But I got a message from a physician saying the formatting was breaking their workflow, and I can't stop thinking about it.

This is the thing about building tools people depend on—their problems become your problems. Their frustrations keep you awake. Their success makes you irrationally happy.

I could leave the bug until tomorrow. But that physician starts their shift in a few hours, and they deserve tools that work. So I'm fixing it now. Coffee-fueled debugging at 2 AM. Building this thing one sleepless night at a time.
