Fifty days. Halfway through this reflection series. A good moment to take stock.

The project has grown beyond my wildest early hopes. The community is engaged and supportive. The tools are actually helping physicians reclaim time. The feedback loop is working—problems get identified and fixed quickly.

But there's so much left to do. More specialties to support. More workflows to optimize. More physicians to reach. Better documentation to write. Stronger community structures to build.

The gap between where we are and where I want to be feels enormous. But the gap between where we are and where we started is enormous too. Progress is real, even when the destination feels far away.

Onward. Another fifty days. Another fifty reflections. More building. More learning. More growing. Together.
