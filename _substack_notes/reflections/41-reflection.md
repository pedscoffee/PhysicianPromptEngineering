Teaching physicians to prompt engineer is more important than giving them prompts.

Give someone a fish versus teach them to fish, right? If physicians just copy my prompts, they're dependent on me. But if they learn the underlying principles, they can create tools for their specific needs.

That's why documentation is such a big part of this project. Not just "here's a prompt" but "here's why this prompt works." Not just "copy this" but "understand this so you can modify it."

Empowerment through education. That's the real goal. Every physician who learns to prompt engineer is one more physician who can solve their own problems. That scales better than any tool I could build alone.
