My partner asked me last night if this project is sustainable.

Fair question. I'm coding after clinic. Answering community questions during lunch. Debugging on weekends. My personal time has essentially become project time. Is that healthy? Probably not.

But here's what I keep coming back to: if I don't do this, who will? Corporate solutions optimize for profit. Academic projects get published and abandoned. Someone needs to build practical, physician-centered tools and maintain them. Right now, that someone is me.

I'm hoping it won't always be this intense. I'm hoping the community grows enough that others can share the load. Until then, I'm running on coffee and stubbornness.
