We're still in beta, and that's exactly where we should be.

This isn't a polished corporate product. It's a living project, constantly evolving based on real physician feedback. Features get added, prompts get refined, bugs get fixed. The beta label gives us permission to iterate quickly and learn from mistakes.

Some people ask when we'll have a "full release." Honestly? Maybe never. Maybe the beta mindset—always learning, always improving, always listening to users—is the mindset this project needs permanently.

Software is never finished. Clinical practice is never finished. Why should physician tools pretend to be finished? Let's stay curious and keep building better.
