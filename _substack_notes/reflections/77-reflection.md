An oncologist told me the standard prompts don't work for her documentation needs.

Cancer care has unique requirements—treatment protocols, staging, side effect monitoring, goals of care discussions. My general prompts miss all the nuance.

She's right. I can't build specialized prompts for every subspecialty. There are too many, and I don't have the expertise.

But here's what I can do: teach her the framework. Give her the tools to build her own oncology-optimized prompts. Support her learning process. Then ask if she'll share what she builds so other oncologists benefit.

This is how the project scales beyond me. Not by my building everything, but by my empowering physicians to build for their specialties. The framework is my contribution. The specialized implementations are theirs.

From one to many. That's how movements grow.
