A psychiatrist sent me her before-and-after metrics.

Before using the prompts: averaging 2.5 hours of documentation per day. After: 45 minutes. She's been tracking for six weeks now. The time savings are consistent.

But the email wasn't really about the metrics. It was about how she's using that extra time. She started a therapy group she'd been wanting to run for two years. She's eating lunch instead of charting through it. She's actually talking to her kids after work.

This is what success looks like. Not just faster documentation, but physicians having lives again.

I keep this email in a folder labeled "Why." For the hard days.
