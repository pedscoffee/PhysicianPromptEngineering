One size doesn't fit all in medicine, and it shouldn't fit all in documentation tools either.

A psychiatrist's documentation needs are completely different from an emergency physician's. Pediatrics requires different language than geriatrics. Outpatient templates don't work for inpatient workflows.

That's why customization is built into everything. The framework provides structure, but physicians modify it for their needs. A cardiologist can add specific sections. A surgeon can streamline for procedures. A primary care doc can optimize for continuity visits.

The best tools are scaffolding, not straitjackets. They support your practice without constraining it. That's what I'm trying to build.
