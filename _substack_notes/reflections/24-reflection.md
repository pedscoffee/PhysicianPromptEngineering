The best part of building in public is the community that forms around it.

Physicians from different specialties, different countries, different career stages—all connected by shared frustration with documentation and shared hope for better solutions. They help each other troubleshoot. They share prompt modifications. They celebrate each other's time savings.

I started this project alone in my kitchen. Now it feels like a movement. Small, scrappy, but real. We're not just building tools. We're building a network of physicians who believe we can solve our own problems.

That sense of collective agency might be even more valuable than the tools themselves.
