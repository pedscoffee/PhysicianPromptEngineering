Not everyone is excited about this project. Some physicians are deeply skeptical.

"AI can't understand medicine." "This will make us worse clinicians." "It's just another tech fad." "Patients deserve human documentation."

I get it. The skepticism is reasonable. We've been burned by technology promises before. We've seen tools that made workflows worse, not better.

All I can say is: try it. Test it on a few notes. See if it actually helps or if it's just hype. This is open source—you risk nothing but time. And if you try it and hate it, that feedback is valuable too.

I'm not asking for blind faith. I'm asking for evidence-based evaluation. That seems fair for a community that values evidence.
