Privacy isn't a feature—it's a foundation.

When physicians share their workflows with me, when they tell me about their documentation struggles, when they test these tools with real patient care... they're trusting me with something sacred.

I will never sell your data. I will never track your usage for advertising. I will never compromise on privacy to chase growth metrics.

This is a promise I make not as a developer, but as a fellow physician. Our patients trust us with their stories. We need to be able to trust our tools the same way. No compromise, no exceptions.
