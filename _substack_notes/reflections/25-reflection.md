Had a breakthrough moment this week that made everything worth it.

A family physician shared her workflow: she uses the intake prompt to structure her history, the clinical reasoning prompt to think through her differential, and the documentation prompt to generate her note. All in real-time during the visit. She said it makes her a better clinician, not just a faster documenter.

That's when I realized we're not just solving documentation burden. We're enhancing clinical practice. The prompts aren't replacing thinking—they're scaffolding it. Supporting it. Making space for it.

This is bigger than I thought. Better than I hoped. And we're just getting started.
