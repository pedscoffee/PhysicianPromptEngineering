A psychiatrist and an orthopedic surgeon walked into my GitHub repository.

Sounds like the start of a joke, but it's actually a beautiful thing. They're collaborating on a prompt for consult notes—applicable to any specialty with modifications. The psychiatrist brings expertise in psychosocial documentation. The surgeon brings efficiency-minded brevity. Together they're building something neither could build alone.

This cross-pollination is magical. Specialties that never interact in hospitals are collaborating here. We're learning from each other's workflows, stealing each other's good ideas, building hybrid solutions.

Medicine fragments us into silos. This project is building bridges. And that might be as valuable as the tools themselves.
