This project stands on the shoulders of so many others.

The open source developers who built the tools I use. The physician bloggers who wrote about burnout before it was mainstream. The researchers who documented documentation burden. The early AI pioneers who made this technology accessible.

I didn't invent anything revolutionary. I'm just combining existing pieces in a way that solves a specific problem for a specific community. That's most innovation, really—recombination more than invention.

Acknowledging influences isn't diminishing the work. It's honest. It's how knowledge builds. We each add our small piece to the collective understanding and pass it forward.

If someone builds on this project someday, using these tools to create something better, that will be success. That will mean the work mattered.
