The goal isn't to replace clinical thinking. It's to support it.

Sometimes I worry these tools could make physicians lazy. Could we start to rely on AI for reasoning instead of doing the cognitive work ourselves? That would be a disaster.

But when I talk to physicians using the prompts, they describe something different. They're using AI as a thinking partner, not a replacement. The clinical reasoning prompt helps them organize their differential, not generate it. The documentation prompt structures their thoughts, not creates them.

Good tools amplify human capability. They don't replace it. That distinction is everything. And it's what I'm constantly trying to preserve as this project grows.
