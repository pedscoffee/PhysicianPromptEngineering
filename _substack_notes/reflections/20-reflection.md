Building in public is terrifying and liberating in equal measure.

Every mistake is visible. Every pivot is documented. Every moment of doubt gets shared with the community. There's nowhere to hide when you're developing in a public GitHub repository.

But there's also no room for BS. I can't oversell features that don't exist. I can't hide behind marketing speak. The code is right there—it either works or it doesn't.

This transparency has built trust faster than any marketing campaign could. Physicians know exactly what they're getting. They can see the development process. They can contribute. They own this as much as I do.

Scary? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely.
