Three years ago, I was finishing notes at midnight every night. I thought it was just part of being a good doctor. My partner would find me at the kitchen table, laptop glowing in the dark, still documenting.

One night, after a particularly brutal shift, I realized I'd spent more time writing about caring for patients than I had actually caring for them. That's when something broke—or maybe when something finally became clear. This wasn't sustainable. This wasn't why I became a physician.

I started looking for solutions. Every vendor wanted to lock me into their system, charge subscription fees, and control my data. I kept thinking: there has to be a better way. A physician-led way.

That's why I started building this.
