There's a specific kind of joy in solving real problems.

Not theoretical problems. Not problems that exist in case studies or business school scenarios. Real, tangible problems that physicians face every single day.

When someone messages me saying "this prompt saved me an hour today," I feel it. That's an hour they got back. An hour for their family, their hobbies, their sleep, their sanity. Multiply that by days, weeks, months. Real time returned to real people.

This is why I became a physician—to help people. Turns out building tools for physicians is just another way to practice medicine. Just on a different scale.
