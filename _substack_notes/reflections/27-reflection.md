This project is deeply personal in ways I don't always talk about.

I've watched physician friends leave medicine. I've seen marriages strained by the hours we spend documenting. I've been to memorials for colleagues who burned out so completely they couldn't find their way back.

Every physician we help stay in medicine is a victory. Every evening returned to a family matters. Every case of burnout prevented saves not just a career but a life.

This isn't hyperbole. The stakes are real. The documentation burden is literally killing us. And if building better tools can help even one physician avoid that fate, then every hour I spend on this project is worth it.
