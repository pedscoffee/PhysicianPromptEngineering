Vendor lock-in is a cage disguised as a solution.

They promise to solve your problems, but only if you use their system, pay their fees, follow their rules. You can't export your data. You can't customize the workflow. You can't even see how the tool makes decisions.

I refuse to build another cage.

Every choice in this project is about physician autonomy. Open source so you can see and modify the code. Local-first options so you control your data. Documentation so you understand how it works. Free core features so cost isn't a barrier.

Freedom isn't just a nice-to-have. It's the entire point.
