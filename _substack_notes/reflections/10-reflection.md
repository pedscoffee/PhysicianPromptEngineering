Balancing clinical work with development is harder than I expected.

I'm still seeing patients. Still doing notes. Still living the problem I'm trying to solve. Some days that feels like an advantage—I'm building with fresh understanding of the pain points. Other days it feels impossible. How do you find energy to code after a twelve-hour shift?

But I think it's essential to stay clinical. The moment I stop practicing medicine is the moment I start building for a theoretical physician instead of real ones. The exhaustion keeps me honest. The late nights remind me why this matters.

I'm living proof that we need better solutions.
