Sometimes I forget that documentation burden isn't normal.

We've normalized it so completely in medicine. "Of course you finish notes at home." "Of course you work through lunch." "Of course you're exhausted." We treat it like weather—something to complain about but never change.

Then I talk to a physician who's new to practice, fresh from residency, and I see it in their eyes: this isn't okay. They haven't been beaten down enough yet to accept it as inevitable.

That fresh perspective is a gift. It reminds me we're not trying to optimize an acceptable situation. We're trying to fix something fundamentally broken. The new doctors are right to be outraged. We should join them.
