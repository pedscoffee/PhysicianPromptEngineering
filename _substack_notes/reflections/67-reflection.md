Got a harsh critique of the project today. It stung.

The criticism was fair—some prompts don't work well for certain subspecialties, the documentation could be clearer, the onboarding process has rough edges. All true. All things I know need improvement.

But knowing something needs work and having someone point it out bluntly are different experiences. My first reaction was defensive. Then I sat with it. Let the sting fade. Came back to the feedback with fresh eyes.

This is how we get better. Not through praise (though that's nice), but through honest criticism from people who care enough to engage. The person who sent that critique spent time writing detailed feedback. That's a gift, even when it hurts.

Ego is the enemy of improvement. I'm trying to keep mine in check.
