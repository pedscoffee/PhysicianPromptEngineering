I'm going back through old code and cringing at what I wrote six months ago.

Functions that do too much. Variable names that make no sense. Comments that explain nothing. The kind of code that makes real developers weep. I'm tempted to rewrite everything.

But there's beauty in the messiness. It's evidence of learning. Each terrible function represents a moment when I didn't know better. Each confusing variable name marks my progress—I understand clarity better now because I experienced confusion then.

I'll refactor the worst offenders. Improve what matters most. But I'm also keeping some of the mess as a reminder: you don't need to be perfect to be useful. You just need to be solving real problems and willing to improve.

Progress over perfection. Always.
