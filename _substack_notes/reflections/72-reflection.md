My partner asked me to stop checking GitHub during dinner.

Fair request. More than fair—overdue. This project has consumed so much of my life that I've forgotten where the boundaries should be. Family time isn't really family time when I'm mentally debugging prompts.

I'm trying to set better limits. Specific work hours for the project. No coding after 10 PM. One day per week completely offline. It's hard. There's always one more thing to fix, one more message to answer, one more feature to build.

But unsustainable intensity doesn't serve anyone. Not me, not my family, not the community. Burned out project founders can't maintain projects. I need to practice what I preach about physician wellbeing.

Starting tonight: no GitHub at dinner. Small step. Overdue step. Necessary step.
