I'm not a software developer. I'm a pediatrician who got frustrated enough to learn how to code.

Some days I feel like a complete imposter. I look at my code and wonder what a "real" developer would think. Then I remember: real developers aren't taking care of patients. They don't understand the specific pain of documentation burden the way physicians do.

Maybe being a physician-developer isn't about being perfect at either. Maybe it's about understanding the problem deeply enough to build something that actually helps. The community has been incredibly patient with my learning curve, and that means everything.
