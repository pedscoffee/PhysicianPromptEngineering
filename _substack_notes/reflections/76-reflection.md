Not every idea works. I'm learning to fail faster and move on.

Last month I built a feature that took forty hours. Got it working. Released it. And... nobody used it. The problem I thought existed didn't actually exist. Or it existed for me but not for others. Or the solution was wrong. Whatever the reason, it failed.

Old me would have doubled down. Marketed it harder. Insisted people just don't understand it yet. Current me deleted it. Forty hours gone, but the codebase is cleaner and I learned what doesn't work.

Failure is information. The faster you fail, the faster you learn. The faster you learn, the better you build. This isn't just startup philosophy—it's scientific method. Test hypothesis, observe results, adjust.

I'm getting better at failing. That might be the most important skill I'm developing.
