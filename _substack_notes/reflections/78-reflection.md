I'm not burned out anymore.

I didn't even notice the shift. It happened gradually. Somewhere between building these tools and using them, between connecting with the community and reclaiming my time, the exhaustion lifted.

I'm finishing work at reasonable hours. I'm present with patients again. I'm remembering why I loved medicine in the first place. The career that felt like it was crushing me is sustainable again.

Partly that's these tools. Partly it's boundary-setting. Partly it's having purpose beyond grinding through patient visits. But whatever the mix, I'm proof that burnout can be reversed. That physicians can heal. That the career is salvageable.

If you're in the thick of burnout right now, reading this: it can get better. You can get better. Hang on. Keep trying. Find your tools, whatever they are. There's a way through.
