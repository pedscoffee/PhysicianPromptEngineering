A healthcare policy researcher asked if these tools could inform policy recommendations.

She's writing about documentation burden reduction. Wants to include physician-led technological solutions as a policy approach. Thinks this project demonstrates what's possible when physicians have autonomy to solve their own problems.

This is a different kind of impact. Not just helping individual physicians, but potentially influencing how healthcare systems think about documentation burden. Demonstrating that solutions don't have to come from vendors or administrators—they can come from physicians themselves.

I'm cautiously optimistic. Policy change is slow. But if this project can contribute even slightly to system-level thinking about physician wellbeing, that multiplies the impact exponentially.

Individual solutions matter. System solutions matter more. Maybe we can contribute to both.
