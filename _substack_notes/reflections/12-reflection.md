Learning prompt engineering felt like learning a new language.

At first, my prompts were terrible. Vague, unfocused, producing inconsistent results. I'd get frustrated when the AI didn't understand what I wanted. Then slowly, I started seeing the patterns. How to structure instructions. How to provide context. How to chain prompts together.

Now I'm teaching other physicians what I learned. The best part? They learn faster than I did because they're starting with better frameworks. They're building on what worked instead of repeating my mistakes.

That's the power of open source. Every failure becomes a lesson. Every success becomes a template. We're all learning together.
