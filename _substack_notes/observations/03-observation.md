Here's something that surprised me: giving an AI 3-5 examples of what you want produces better results than writing pages of detailed instructions.

We call this "few-shot learning" in prompt engineering. It's counterintuitive but incredibly powerful.

Your AI scribe doesn't need a manual. It needs to see your preferred format a few times. That's it.
