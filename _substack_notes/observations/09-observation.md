Your first prompt won't be perfect. That's expected.

The real power comes from iteration: test with 5-10 notes, identify patterns in what needs fixing, update your examples, test again. Repeat until you're consistently happy with the output.

This isn't a "set it and forget it" solution. It's a continuously improving workflow that gets better the more you use it.
