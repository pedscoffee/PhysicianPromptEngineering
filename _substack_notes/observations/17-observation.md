The magic happens in two stages:

Stage 1: AI scribe captures the actual conversation with your patient. Real words, real context, real details.

Stage 2: Custom prompt transforms that output into your exact documentation style.

Generic capture + personalized formatting = notes that sound like you, require minimal editing, and take minutes instead of hours.
