One prompt that tries to do everything usually does nothing well.

Better approach: dedicated prompts for specific tasks. One for A&P formatting. Another for billing analysis. A third for patient instructions.

Modular design means each prompt is focused, testable, and reliable. When something breaks, you know exactly where to look.
