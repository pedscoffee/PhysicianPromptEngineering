> Open-source clinical documentation prompts that transform AI scribe output into physician-ready notes in seconds.

## 🎯 Overview

**Physician Prompt Engineering** provides production-ready prompts that convert raw AI transcripts into perfectly formatted clinical notes matching your exact documentation style—no manual editing required.

### The Problem
AI scribes capture conversations but produce generic, verbose notes requiring extensive editing.

### Our Solution
Precision-engineered prompts that transform raw AI output into concise, personalized documentation using your EMR's built-in AI features.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🏥 EMR-Ready Prompts**: Works with any EMR just need HIPAA safe/IT approved LLM
- **⏱️ Time Savings**: Minutes saved on each encounter
- **📋 Specialty Agnostic**: Core framework adaptable to any medical specialty
- **🔒 HIPAA Compliant**: Designed for use within secure EMR environments
- **👥 Community-Driven**: Contributed and tested by practicing physicians

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- EMR with integrated AI text generation (e.g., Epic's "Generate Text with AI")
- Institutional approval for AI documentation tools
- HIPAA-compliant AI scribe service (optional but recommended)

### Getting Started

1. **Browse Available Prompts**
   ```
   Visit: https://physicianpromptengineering.com/prompt-library
   ```

2. **Select Your Use Case**
   - Assessment & Plan formatting
   - Medical Decision Making & billing
   - After-Visit Summaries
   - Custom specialty prompts

3. **Copy & Customize**
   - Replace example content with your own documentation samples
   - Test with 5-10 routine encounters
   - Refine based on results

4. **Scale Up**
   - Expand to complex cases
   - Share improvements with the community
