# Physician Prompt Engineering

An open-source initiative to improve clinical documentation with practical AI.

**It's time to stop sprinting—come take the subway.**

---

## What Is This?

Physician Prompt Engineering provides production-ready AI prompts that transform raw conversation transcripts into perfectly formatted clinical notes in seconds.

Combine:
- ✓ **AI Scribes** (listen to your patient conversation)
- ✓ **AI Editor Prompts** (format exactly to your preferences)
- = **Fully automated, personalized clinical notes**

---

## The Three Big Insights

1. **Few-shot examples are critical** - Show, don't tell
2. **Brevity improves quality** - Shorter = faster approval
3. **Separate prompts for separate functions** - Each does one thing well

---

## Who Is This For?

This project is designed for **any clinician** who:
- Uses an AI scribe (Doximity, Epic, etc.)
- Has access to an EMR-integrated LLM
- Wants fully automated, personalized clinical notes
- Values reclaiming time for actual patient care

While examples are pediatric, the principles and prompts are adaptable to all specialties.

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Use Your AI Scribe
Have a normal conversation with your patient. Your AI scribe records and transcribes it.

### Step 2: Run Your Prompt
Copy one of our prompts and paste it into your EMR's AI tool, followed by the scribe output.

### Step 3: Review (Takes 30 Seconds)
The formatted note appears. You review for accuracy and approve.

### Step 4: Done
No more typing or formatting. Notes are ready for your chart.

## Important Disclaimers

### HIPAA Compliance
- ⚠️ **Only use within HIPAA-compliant EMR environments**
- ⚠️ **DO NOT use public AI tools** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) with patient data
- ✓ Use your EMR's integrated LLM or approved tools only

### Clinical Responsibility
- You retain full responsibility for note accuracy
- Always review generated content before finalizing
- These are tools to assist, not replace your judgment
- Edge cases require clinical review

### Billing & Coding
- Billing prompt is a suggestion tool, not guarantees accuracy
- Always verify codes with your compliance officer
- Use as an audit trail, not absolute truth

See [FAQ & Disclaimers](pages/faq.md) for complete details.
