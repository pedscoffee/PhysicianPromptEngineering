> Open-source clinical documentation prompts that transform AI scribe output into physician-ready notes in seconds.

## Overview

**Physician Prompt Engineering** provides production-ready prompts that convert raw AI transcripts into perfectly formatted clinical notes matching your exact documentation style—no manual editing required.

### The Problem
AI scribes capture conversations but produce generic, verbose notes requiring extensive editing.

### Our Solution
Precision-engineered prompts that transform raw AI output into concise, personalized documentation using your EMR's built-in AI features.

## Key Features

- **Practical**: Prompts built and verified by real world testing
- **Specialty-Agnostic**: Core framework adaptable to any medical specialty

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- EMR with integrated AI text generation (e.g., Epic's "Generate Text with AI")
- Institutional approval for tools
- HIPAA-compliant AI scribe service (optional but recommended)

### Getting Started

1. **Browse Available Prompts**
   ```
   Visit: https://physicianpromptengineering.com/prompt-library
   ```

2. **Select Your Use Case**
   - Assessment & Plan formatting
   - Medical Decision Making & billing
   - After-Visit Summaries
   - Custom specialty prompts

3. **Copy & Customize**
   - Replace example content with your own documentation samples
   - Test with 5-10 routine encounters
   - Refine based on results

4. **Scale Up**
   - Expand to complex cases
   - Share improvements with the community

### Core Resources

- **[Website](https://physicianpromptengineering.com/)** - Main portal with all tools and resources
- **[Best Practices Guide](https://physicianpromptengineering.com/best-practices)** - Evidence-based prompt engineering principles
- **[Prompt Library](https://physicianpromptengineering.com/prompt-library)** - Tested, production-ready prompts
- **[Interactive Course](https://physicianpromptengineering.com/courses/clinical-prompt-engineering/)** - Hands-on learning with real scenarios
- **[Blog](https://physicianpromptengineering.com/blog)** - Latest insights and case studies

### Tools

- **[A&P Prompt Generator](https://physicianpromptengineering.com/prompt-generator)** - Create customized Assessment & Plan prompts
- **[Prompt Manager](https://physicianpromptengineering.com/prompt-manager)** - Organize and manage your prompt library locally
- **[E&M Calculator](https://physicianpromptengineering.com/cpt-calculator)** - CPT code complexity analysis
- **[Dot Phrase Library](https://physicianpromptengineering.com/dot-phrase-library)** - Reusable EMR text snippets

### Key Principles

Our approach is grounded in three principles:

1. **Few-Shot Examples > Instructions**: 3-5 examples of your desired output teach AI better than lengthy explanations
2. **Brevity = Quality**: Concise notes scan faster, reduce cognitive load, and minimize review time
3. **Modular Design**: Specialized prompts for specific tasks outperform multi-purpose solutions

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### Clinical Responsibility
- All AI-generated content requires physician review before finalizing
- These tools enhance efficiency, not replace clinical judgment
- You retain full responsibility for the output including anything assisted or produced by these tools

### Security Requirements
- **ONLY** use within HIPAA-compliant and IT approved environments and workflows
- **NEVER** use public AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) with patient data
- Follow your institution's AI usage policies

### No Medical Advice
This project provides educational tools only. It does not constitute medical, legal, or billing advice.
