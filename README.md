> Physician-tested AI prompts that convert AI scribe output into your exact documentation style—no manual editing required.

## Overview

**Physician Prompt Engineering** is an open-source initiative providing production-ready prompts, interactive learning tools, and productivity applications for clinical AI documentation.

### The Problem We Solve

AI scribes capture conversations but produce generic, verbose notes requiring extensive editing. 

### Our Solution

Precision-engineered prompts that transform raw AI output into concise, personalized documentation matching your exact preferences—using your EMR's built-in AI features.

## Three Essential Clinical Prompts

Our most impactful prompts for immediate use:

1. **Assessment & Plan Formatting** - Converts verbose paragraphs into concise, problem-oriented documentation
2. **Medical Decision Making & Billing** - Analyzes clinical complexity and suggests appropriate CPT codes
3. **After-Visit Summaries** - Generates patient-friendly instructions and follow-up plans

[Access all prompts in our library →](https://physicianpromptengineering.com/prompt-library)

## Core Principles

Our approach is grounded in three principles:

1. **Examples Drive Quality** - 3-5 examples of your desired output teach AI better than lengthy instructions
2. **Conciseness Improves Efficiency** - Brief, scannable notes reduce review time and minimize editing
3. **Modular Design Ensures Reliability** - Dedicated prompts for specific tasks outperform multi-purpose solutions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- EMR with integrated AI text generation (e.g., Epic's "Generate Text with AI")
- Institutional approval for AI documentation tools
- HIPAA-compliant AI scribe service (optional but recommended)

### Implementation Steps

1. **Copy relevant prompts** from our library
2. **Customize examples** to match your specialty
3. **Test with routine encounters** first
4. **Scale to complex cases** as confidence builds
