# Physician Prompt Engineering

An open-source initiative to improve clinical documentation with practical AI.

**It's time to stop sprinting—come take the subway.**

---

## What Is This?

Physician Prompt Engineering provides production-ready AI prompts that transform raw conversation transcripts into perfectly formatted clinical notes in seconds.

Combine:
- ✓ **AI Scribes** (listen to your patient conversation)
- ✓ **AI Editor Prompts** (format exactly to your preferences)
- = **Fully automated, personalized clinical notes**

---

## The Three Big Insights

1. **Few-shot examples are critical** - Show, don't tell
2. **Brevity improves quality** - Shorter = faster approval
3. **Separate prompts for separate functions** - Each does one thing well
