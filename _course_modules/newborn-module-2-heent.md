## Cranial Findings

### Common Benign Findings
- **Caput succedaneum**: Crosses suture lines, resolves 24-48 hours
- **Cephalohematoma**: Doesn't cross sutures, may take weeks to resolve
- **Molding**: Temporary head shape changes from passage through birth canal

### Fontanelles
- **Anterior**: Diamond-shaped, closes 9-18 months
- **Posterior**: Triangular, closes by 2-3 months
- Assess: Size, tension (should be soft and flat), pulsations
