## The Problem We All Know

For years, clinical documentation has eaten our lives. We spend more time in computers than with patients. It's exhausting.

The previous generation's advance of moving from paper charts to computers was a good one. It enabled continuity of care that wasn't possible before. But it had unintended consequences.

Now, when we do our work, we spend most of our effort just trying to get the details of what we're doing into that machine so we can be paid and get our liability covered. We've been sucked into a world where most of our energy during the day gets poured into our computers instead of being spent actually taking care of patients.

It's become the social norm for families when they go to the doctorâ€”they expect us to have our nose in the computer and hardly make eye contact. It steals the joy out of our job, and it's high time for a change.

## The Good News

**Things have changed. Things are better.**

There is a new, better way to get your charting done. It is more efficient, it produces better documentation, and it works.

But it is a change. It's different than what we've been doing, and we've been doing things the way we have for a while. Change can be hard, but I encourage you to check out this content and this new way of approaching the same problem. 

**This is not just better documentation. It's a fundamentally different way of working.** You're free to actually engage with patients instead of your screen.

## ðŸ”‘ The Three Big Insights

1. **Few-shot examples are critical** - Show, don't tell. Examples guide output better than instructions.

2. **Brevity improves quality** - Shorter bullets = faster scanning and easier approval. Less editing required.

3. **Separate prompts for separate functions** - Each prompt does one thing well. Can be used independently or together.
