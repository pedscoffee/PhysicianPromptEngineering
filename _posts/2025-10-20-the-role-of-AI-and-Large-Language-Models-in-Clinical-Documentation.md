# The Role of AI and Large Language Models in Clinical Documentation: A Practical Guide

-----

## The Current State of Clinical Documentation

Clinical documentation has become one of the most time-consuming aspects of modern medical practice. Physicians spend hours a day in front of a computer, contributing significantly to professional burnout and reducing time available for patient interaction.

While the transition from paper charts to electronic health records has enabled improved care coordination and information accessibility, it has also created substantial administrative burden. Physicians report that documentation requirements often detract from patient-centered care and clinical reasoning—the core activities that define medical practice.

## Traditional Documentation Methods

### Template-Based Systems

Most EHR systems, including Epic, Cerner, and others, offer template functionality such as:

- **Dot phrases/Smart phrases:** Pre-saved text blocks for common scenarios
- **Smart lists:** Dropdown menus with selectable options
- **Macros:** Automated text insertion tools

These tools have provided incremental efficiency gains for routine documentation.

### Inherent Limitations

Template-based documentation faces a fundamental challenge: it excels at capturing routine, common elements but struggles with patient-specific details. The most clinically valuable information—what makes each patient unique, the nuanced decision-making process, and contextual factors—requires manual entry regardless of template sophistication.

For complex patients, social circumstances, or atypical presentations, physicians must still manually add substantial narrative detail. This creates a persistent bottleneck where documentation speed is limited by typing or dictation capabilities, typically adding 2-5 minutes per patient encounter.

## Emerging AI-Assisted Documentation Workflow

### Technology Overview

Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled AI-powered medical scribes that can transcribe and structure clinical conversations. These tools utilize:

- **Automatic speech recognition (ASR):** Converts spoken language to text via ambient scribe
- **Large language models (LLMs):** Process and structure information according to medical documentation standards

While sophisticated, these technologies represent an evolution of existing transcription and natural language processing capabilities rather than entirely novel approaches.

### Two-Stage Workflow

#### Stage 1: Ambient Recording and Transcription

AI scribe tools (such as Doximity’s free offering, Nuance’s DAX Copilot, or other HIPAA-compliant platforms) record clinical encounters and generate either:

- Complete transcripts of the conversation
- Preliminary structured notes in standard formats (SOAP, HPI, etc.)

**Important considerations:**

- Must be approved by institutional IT and compliance departments
- Requires patient consent
- Should comply with applicable privacy regulations (HIPAA, etc.)

#### Stage 2: Customization Through Prompt Engineering

The second stage involves using custom prompts to refine the initial output. A prompt serves as a set of instructions for an LLM to reformat, reorganize, or enhance the scribe output according to individual preferences, specialty requirements, or institutional standards.

This approach allows physicians to:

- Maintain consistency with their existing documentation style
- Incorporate specialty-specific terminology and structure
- Meet local compliance and billing requirements
- Preserve their clinical voice while reducing manual typing

## Implementation Considerations

### Getting Started

1. **Verify institutional approval:** Confirm that AI scribe tools meet your organization’s security and compliance requirements
1. **Start with simple cases:** Begin with routine visits to develop comfort with the workflow
1. **Experiment with prompts:** Use available prompt templates as starting points, then modify based on your needs
1. **Maintain quality oversight:** Always review and edit AI-generated content before signing

### Limitations and Risks

**Current limitations include:**

- Accuracy depends on audio quality and clear speech
- May miss non-verbal clinical findings
- Requires physician review and editing for accuracy
- Not suitable for all clinical scenarios
- Variable performance across specialties and clinical settings

**Risk mitigation strategies:**

- Never release documentation without personal review
- Maintain backup documentation methods
- Report errors to improve system performance
- Stay current with evolving best practices

### Regulatory and Ethical Considerations

- Informed consent for recording conversations
- Data security and patient privacy protection
- Liability considerations for AI-generated content
- Documentation integrity and authenticity
- Compliance with billing and coding regulations

## Evidence and Outcomes

While this technology is relatively new, preliminary experience suggests potential benefits:

- Reduced documentation time per patient encounter
- Increased proportion of time spent in direct patient interaction
- Substantial reduction in after-hours charting 

Physicians should remain aware that evidence is still emerging, and outcomes may vary based on practice setting, specialty, and implementation approach.

## Resources for Further Learning

For physicians interested in exploring AI-assisted documentation:

- Review your institution’s approved vendors and tools
- Consult with colleagues who have implemented these workflows
- Explore prompt engineering basics and best practices
- Consider starting with a small pilot before full implementation

The goal is not to replace physician judgment but to automate routine aspects of documentation, allowing more cognitive resources for clinical reasoning and patient care.

## Conclusion

AI-assisted clinical documentation represents a meaningful evolution in addressing documentation burden. While not a complete solution to all EHR challenges, it offers a practical approach to reducing time spent on routine data entry while preserving the clinical detail necessary for quality care.

As with any new clinical tool, implementation should be thoughtful, evidence-informed, and accompanied by appropriate oversight. Physicians who adopt these technologies should maintain high standards for documentation quality while exploring efficiency gains.
