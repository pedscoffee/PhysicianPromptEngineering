# Introducing the Prompt Generator!

    Prompt engineering, large language models (LLMs), and AI in general can be intidimating at first.  Part of the goal of this resource is to help make LLMs approachable.  Since Windows 95 and iPhones a lot of us have become accustomed to a cycle of each new wave of technology requiring a lot of time and effort to get used to only for everything to change again.  Thankfully, this dynamic is about to get a lot better.    

    The core innovation of large language models is that you can ask questions naturally and get feedback in the moment.  It is as if the tool comes with its own interactive handbook. 

    I encourage you to start exploring these tools by just asking it to tell you about itself.  You'll quickly find LLMs are able to be really helpful, and also that there's a lot they still don't know.

    This prompt generator is another great place to start.  You can select from a menu of choices and then watch as it gives you the prompt ready to go!  [Test it out](https://physicianpromptengineering.com/prompt-generator/) and see what you think!

    Once you have used your prompt a bit you can try modifying the prompt to fit your exact preferences.  The few shot examples where you write out hypothetical examples of the type of output you'd like to see are the real key to getting these tools to work well.  Keep note of what you like and what you'd like to change, and then keep iterating until your notes are perfect!  The goal is to find a prompt that helps the scribe output hardly ever need to be modified, only reviewed for accuracy.  

Best of luck and let us know what you think!
