# Beyond the AI Hype: Why Physicians Should Talk More about Large Language Models and less about Artificial Intelligence

The technology industry's obsession with "artificial intelligence" has created an adoption barrier that shouldn't exist. Here's why reframing Large Language Models (LLMs) as tools—not intelligence— could accelerate their clinical utility.

## The Hype Problem

When ChatGPT launched, the medical community was simultaneously promised everything and warned about everything. Headlines proclaimed AI would replace *all knowledge workers* while cautionary tales warned of hallucinations, bias, and potential for patient harm. This whiplash of expectations created paralysis where there should have been pragmatic evaluation and adoption.

The ironu is that if large language models (LLMs) had been introduced as "Advanced Documentation Assistance" or "Pattern-Based Text Generation"—essentially true descriptions—physicians would likely already be using them as routinely as spell check.  One of the original descriptions of neural networks was **"Software 2.0"** ([Karpathy](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35), 2017).  Software 2.0 isn't going to get a bunch of investors interested in your stock nearly as much as saying you've developed ***artificial intelligence***, but it would have fostered a much more open attitude towards trying out these new tools.

*Today's Hot Take:  It is better to call large language models ***"Dictionary Math Discoveries"*** than Artificial Intelligence*

### Other Suggested Labels for LLMs
- Dictionary Math Discoveries
- Sequential Suggestion Systems
- Statistical Statement Synthesizers
- Pattern Predicting Print Producers

## The Spell Check Parallel

Consider spell check.  When you started using it in likely email or Word, did you care about how it worked?  It was some neat dictionary based math that was helpful.  Slowly new features were introduced that allowed for grammer suggestions, and over time tools like Grammerly were released that could give college students feedback on thier papers and serve as study aids.  Google started to autocomplete your searches as you were typing them and then your phone started to try to help you text faster.

Each advancement was adopted without fanfare because it was framed as an incremental improvement to existing tools.  LLMs are simply the next step: pattern recognition sophisticated enough to generate useful text based on examples. Nothing more mystical than autocomplete with vastly better training data (the entire internet) and a whole lot of math (so much math).  

Don't get me wrong --Large Language Models are an incredible breakthrough.  There's a new way we can now interact with computers.  That is amazing, but it is important to keep it in the right context.  

## What We Lost to Hype

### Immediate Practical Applications

While many turned to science fiction to flame the fears surrounding this new innovation, physicians could have been:
- Reformatting notes with simple prompts
- Generating patient instructions instantly
- Quickly documenting billing rationale

These aren't futuristic AI applications—they're text transformation tasks LLMs can handle today.

### Realistic Expectations

The AI narrative created impossible expectations. Physicians expected either:
- Fully autonomous documentation (disappointment inevitable)
- Dangerous hallucinations (excessive fear)

Reality sits between: LLMs as powerful but limited tools requiring human oversight—like every other clinical tool we use.  Had LLMs been introduced as just another software update, physicians could have immediately started experimenting, sharing discoveries, and optimizing workflows. Instead, the AI hype triggered a lot of unneccessary apprehension.

The technology works. It's been working. The barrier isn't technical—it's conceptual.
