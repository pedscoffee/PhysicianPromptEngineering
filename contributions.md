* **Your Specialty:** (e.g., Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Surgery)
* **Prompt Title:** A clear, short name for your prompt.
* **Use Cases:** What problem does this prompt solve? (e.g., "Formats hospital discharge summaries," "Generates patient education handouts")
* **How You've Tested It:** A brief note on how you've used this in your workflow.
* **The Prompt Itself:** The full, copy-and-paste-ready text of your prompt.
