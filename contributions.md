We are building a community-driven library, and we need your expertise. If you are a physician who has developed your own custom prompts, please share them!

Each prompt is valuable on its own terms, and in addressing different problems we may find new approaches and underlying principles that will make all of our prompts better. The vision is a shared library where any clinician could come and benefit from each other's tools and insights. We shouldn't all invent the wheel separately.  Let's work together. -PedsCoffee‚òïÔ∏èüè•‚òïÔ∏è

To start, check us out on GitHub! There is a [Discussions](https://github.com/pedscoffee/PhysicianPromptEngineering/discussions) board that is a great place to get started.

### What to Include

When submitting your prompt, please include the following details so others can understand and use it effectively:

* **Your Specialty:** (e.g., Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Surgery)
* **Prompt Title:** A clear, short name for your prompt.
* **Use Cases:** What problem does this prompt solve? (e.g., "Formats hospital discharge summaries," "Generates patient education handouts")
* **How You've Tested It:** A brief note on how you've used this in your workflow.
* **The Prompt Itself:** The full, copy-and-paste-ready text of your prompt.
