# Episode 7: Building a Sustainable Workflow

**Episode Title:** Building a Sustainable Workflow: Long-Term Integration

**Length:** 25-30 minutes

**Goal:** Help listeners move from experimentation to sustainable, integrated practice

---

## Opening (2-3 min)

**Hook:**
- "Getting AI documentation to work once is exciting"
- "Getting it to work reliably for years is transformative"
- "Today: building workflows that last"

**Why sustainability matters:**
- Experimentation phase is easy
- Long-term consistent use is hard
- Most tools fail at adoption, not capability
- Sustainable = actual time savings realized

**What we're covering:**
- Moving from pilot to practice
- Integration with existing workflows
- Team adoption strategies
- Maintenance and iteration
- Avoiding common pitfalls

---

## From Pilot to Practice (6-7 min)

**The pilot phase (where you are now):**
- Testing on select cases
- High attention and review
- Learning what works
- Building confidence
- Still using backup methods

**Transitioning to regular use:**

**Week 1-2: Controlled expansion**
- Use on all routine cases
- Complex cases still manual (for now)
- Extra careful review
- Document what works, what doesn't
- Track time saved

**Week 3-4: Increasing complexity**
- Add moderately complex cases
- Still avoid edge cases
- Refine prompts based on patterns
- Build muscle memory
- Reduce backup method use

**Week 5-8: Full integration**
- Use on all appropriate cases
- Rare exceptions only
- Review becomes routine (not paranoid)
- Trust the process
- Backup only for emergencies

**Signs you're ready to fully adopt:**
- 90%+ of outputs acceptable with minor edits
- Comfortable reviewing quickly
- Time savings consistent
- Quality maintained or improved
- You trust the tool

**Signs you need more iteration:**
- Still getting surprised by outputs
- Spending more time reviewing than writing would take
- Quality concerns
- Inconsistent results
- Frequent need for major edits

## Workflow Integration Strategies (7-8 min)

**Integration point 1: During the visit**
- AI scribe running (if available)
- Capture conversation naturally
- Don't change your clinical approach
- Document real-time or immediately after

**Integration point 2: End of visit**
- Review AI scribe output
- Run through your formatting prompt
- Quick review of formatted output
- Sign if accurate, edit if needed
- Move to next patient

**Integration point 3: End of session**
- Catch-up on any unsigned
- Batch process if needed
- Quality check day's documentation
- Close out efficiently

**Efficiency tips:**

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
- Save prompts as quick text
- One-click paste and generate
- Minimize clicking
- Smooth workflow

**Screen arrangement:**
- AI tool on one screen
- EMR on another
- Copy/paste flow
- No tab switching

**Template structure:**
- Keep prompt template ready
- Variable section clearly marked
- Fast to populate
- Consistent process

**Review checklist:**
- Accuracy: facts correct?
- Completeness: nothing missed?
- Format: matches your style?
- Billing: complexity captured?
- Safety: any concerning hallucinations?

**Time management:**
- Set aside prompt refinement time weekly
- Don't iterate during clinical time
- Batch improvements
- Scheduled maintenance

## Team Adoption (6-7 min)

**If you're in a group practice:**

**Individual success first:**
- Get it working for yourself
- Document results
- Build credibility
- Then share with team

**Sharing with colleagues:**

**What works:**
- Show, don't tell (demo on real note)
- Share time savings data
- Offer to help setup
- Start with interested colleagues
- One-on-one teaching

**What doesn't work:**
- Mandatory adoption without training
- Assuming one prompt works for everyone
- No support during learning curve
- Top-down decree without resources
- Ignoring specialty differences

**Building team prompts:**
- Start with individual prompts
- Identify common elements
- Create team standard prompt
- Allow individual customization
- Version control for updates

**Training new team members:**
- Provide prompt templates
- Pair with experienced user
- Monitor first week closely
- Iterate based on their specialty/style
- Build their confidence

**Institutional scaling:**

**Pilot group:**
- 3-5 interested physicians
- Different specialties if possible
- Document process and results
- Gather feedback
- Refine approach

**Expansion phase:**
- Share pilot results
- Provide training resources
- Ongoing support structure
- Community for questions
- Celebrate successes

**Maintenance:**
- Regular prompt updates
- New feature training
- Quality monitoring
- Address issues quickly
- Keep improving

---

## Maintenance and Iteration (4-5 min)

**Regular prompt review:**
- Monthly: quick check for systematic issues
- Quarterly: thorough review and update
- Annually: major revision if needed
- When EMR updates: test compatibility
- When AI models update: retest performance

**Version control:**
- Track prompt changes
- Date versions
- Note what changed and why
- Keep previous versions accessible
- Can roll back if needed

**Performance tracking:**
- Time saved per note
- Edit time required
- Quality scores
- Billing capture
- Colleague feedback

**When to iterate:**
- Consistent type of error
- New documentation requirements
- Model capability improvements
- Specialty practice evolution
- User feedback patterns

**When not to iterate:**
- Random one-off issues
- Already working well (don't break it)
- Change for change's sake
- Based on single feedback
- During high-stress periods

**Backup plan maintenance:**
- Keep manual method functional
- Practice occasionally
- For system outages
- For AI failures
- For patient preferences

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls (3-4 min)

**Pitfall 1: Over-reliance**
- Still need to read every note
- AI assists, doesn't replace judgment
- Keep clinical skills sharp
- Don't stop reviewing

**Pitfall 2: Prompt creep**
- Adding features until unwieldy
- Keep it simple
- Multiple focused prompts > one complex prompt
- Resist feature bloat

**Pitfall 3: Ignoring feedback**
- Systematic issues need addressing
- Don't accept subpar results
- Iterate based on real problems
- Listen to users (yourself and team)

**Pitfall 4: No backup plan**
- AI will fail sometimes
- Network issues happen
- Have manual method ready
- Don't be stranded

**Pitfall 5: Stopping improvement**
- "Good enough" can get better
- Technology improves
- Your skills improve
- Keep learning
