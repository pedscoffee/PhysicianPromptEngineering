## Customization Strategies (7-8 min)

**Strategy 1: Specialty-specific examples**
- Use notes from YOUR specialty
- Not generic internal medicine
- Show the unique elements
- Growth charts, procedures, mental status, etc.

**Strategy 2: Terminology and abbreviations**
- Include in your examples
- AI learns your specialty's language
- "Ex lap" vs "exploratory laparotomy"
- Consistent abbreviation use

**Strategy 3: Structure variations**
- SOAP vs APSO vs procedure note format
- What structure does your specialty use?
- Examples enforce structure
- AI replicates it reliably

**Strategy 4: Detail level**
- Surgery needs procedure detail
- Primary care needs different detail
- Your examples set the standard
- Brief vs comprehensive

**Strategy 5: Audience considerations**
- Who reads your notes?
- Other specialists, generalists, patients?
- Adjust technical level appropriately
- Examples show the right level

**Strategy 6: Billing emphasis**
- What gets reimbursed in your specialty?
- Procedure documentation
- MDM complexity
- Time-based billing
- Ensure AI captures it

## Advanced Prompting Techniques (6-7 min)

**Technique 1: Conditional formatting**
```
"If the note mentions a procedure, include detailed
procedural documentation. Otherwise, use standard
problem-oriented format."
```
- Prompts can have logic
- Different outputs based on input
- More sophisticated than simple formatting

**Technique 2: Chain-of-thought prompting**
```
"First, identify all problems mentioned. Second,
for each problem, extract assessment and plan.
Third, format in problem-oriented structure."
```
- Break complex task into steps
- AI follows the logic
- Better results on complex notes

**Technique 3: Role-based prompting**
```
"You are an experienced pediatrician documenting
a well-child visit. Focus on development, growth,
and anticipatory guidance."
```
- Defining the role shapes output
- Specialty expertise implied
- Better specialty-appropriate language

**Technique 4: Multiple output options**
```
"Generate three versions: brief, standard, and
comprehensive. I'll choose based on case complexity."
```
- Gives you options
- Choose best fit for each case
- Flexibility in output

**Technique 5: Template injection**
```
"Use this exact template structure: [template].
Fill in based on AI scribe content."
```
- When you must use specific format
- Institutional requirements
- Billing templates
- AI populates the template

**Technique 6: Specialty-specific safety checks**
```
"For pediatric notes, always include: age, weight,
developmental milestones if well visit,
anticipatory guidance."
```
- Prevent omissions
- Specialty-specific quality check
- Built into the prompt

- Side effect monitoring
- Safety assessment
- Next appointment plan

**Example 4: Hospital medicine progress note**

## Actionable Takeaway (2-3 min)

**Adapt your prompt for your specialty:**

1. **Audit your documentation needs:**
   - What's unique about your specialty?

2. **Gather specialty-specific examples:**
   - Pull your 5 best notes
   - Make sure they show specialty elements
   - De-identify them
   - Use as your few-shot examples

3. **Test on specialty-specific cases:**
   - Routine and complex
   - Different types within specialty
