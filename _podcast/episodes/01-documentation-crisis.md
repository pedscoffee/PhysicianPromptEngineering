## Opening Hook (2-3 min)

**Start with a personal story:**
- Describe a specific night finishing notes at midnight
- Family asleep, you're still typing
- The weight of knowing tomorrow will be the same
- "If this sounds familiar, this podcast is for you"

**Episode introduction:**
- Welcome to Physician Prompt Engineering podcast
- Who you are and why you built this
- What this series will cover (overview of 8 episodes)

## The Hidden Cost of Documentation (5-7 min)

**The time burden:**
- 2-3 hours per day on documentation (cite this statistic)
- 500-750 hours per year
- What could you do with 500 extra hours?
- Calculate actual cost at physician hourly rate

**The mental burden:**
- Anxiety of incomplete notes
- Guilt leaving work undone
- Cognitive load of remembering what to document
- Decision fatigue from documentation on top of clinical decisions

**The emotional toll:**
- Pajama time as normalized burnout
- Missing family dinners, kids' activities
- Feeling like documentation takes over your life
- Many physicians considering leaving medicine because of this

**Share your personal breaking point:**
- The moment you realized this wasn't sustainable
- What specifically triggered your decision to find solutions
- How it was affecting your life and practice

## Why EMRs Made It Worse (5-7 min)

**The promise vs. reality:**
- EMRs were supposed to improve efficiency
- They did improve data accessibility and care coordination
- But created massive documentation burden
- Copy-paste culture, bloat, checkbox medicine

**Templates have a ceiling:**
- Dot phrases and templates help with routine stuff
- But fail to capture what matters most
- The unique patient context
- Your clinical reasoning
- Subtle findings and nuances
- Everything that makes you a good physician

**The personalization gap:**
- Generic templates don't reflect your practice style
- Can't capture specialty-specific needs
- Don't adapt to complex cases
- You still end up typing detailed narratives for anything unique

**Why this matters:**
- Documentation burden is a major driver of burnout
- Burnout is reaching crisis levels
- We're losing good physicians
- This is a solvable problem

## What's Different Now (5-7 min)

**Technology has caught up:**
- Large language models represent a fundamental shift
- Not just better templates - actually different capability
- Can handle both routine AND unique cases
- Can understand context and nuance

**The two-stage revolution:**
- Stage 1: AI scribe captures the actual conversation
- Stage 2: Custom prompts format it to your exact preferences
- This breaks through the template ceiling
- Handles personalization at scale

**Real results from real physicians:**
- Time savings: 2-5 minutes per routine visit, up to 15 on complex
- Better work-life balance: home on time, no pajama time
- Improved note quality: more complete, consistent formatting
- Reduced cognitive load: less mental energy on prose construction

**Why you should care:**
- This isn't experimental or futuristic
- It's working today in real EMRs
- Epic, Cerner, others have AI features built in
- The barrier isn't technical - it's awareness and adoption
