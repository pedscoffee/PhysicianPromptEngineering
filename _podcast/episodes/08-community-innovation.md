## Why Open Source Matters (6-7 min)

**The closed model:**
- Company builds tool
- Sells it to physicians
- Black box algorithms
- Subscription fees
- Vendor lock-in
- Their priorities, not yours

**The open source alternative:**
- Physicians build tools
- Share freely with colleagues
- Transparent code and prompts
- No fees, no subscriptions
- Complete control
- Our priorities, for us

**Why this matters for medicine:**

**Ownership and control:**
- You own your workflow
- You control your prompts
- No vendor can take it away
- No price increases
- No forced upgrades
- True physician autonomy

**Transparency:**
- See exactly how it works
- Audit for safety
- Understand limitations
- Trust through visibility
- No hidden agendas

**Customization:**
- Modify for your needs
- Fork for your specialty
- Share improvements back
- Collective benefits
- Rapid iteration

**Community:**
- Physicians helping physicians
- Shared knowledge
- Collective problem-solving
- No profit motive
- Just better patient care

**Sustainability:**
- Not dependent on one company
- Community maintains it
- Survives beyond any individual
- Built to last
- For the long term

**Why this approach is rare but important:**
- Healthcare tech usually proprietary
- Doctors usually consumers, not creators
- This flips the model
- Physicians as developers
- Building for ourselves

## Community-Driven Innovation in Action (6-7 min)

**How community improves prompts:**

**Contribution cycle:**
1. Physician uses prompt, finds issue
2. Modifies prompt to fix issue
3. Shares improvement with community
4. Others test and refine further
5. Best version becomes new standard
6. Repeat continuously

**Example: The A&P prompt evolution**
- v1.0: Basic formatting
- v1.1: Community added conciseness constraint
- v1.2: Better examples from pediatrician
- v2.0: Billing emphasis from hospitalist
- v2.1: Safety checks from emergency medicine
- Now: 10x better than original, thanks to community

**Specialty-specific branches:**
- One core framework
- Each specialty customizes
- Share specialty-specific versions
- Cross-pollinate good ideas
- Everyone improves

**Collective intelligence:**
- 100 physicians testing prompts
- Faster than any company could
- Real-world validation
- Diverse specialties
- Rapid improvement

**Bug reports and fixes:**
- Community spots issues first
- Reports in discussions
- Proposes solutions
- Tests fixes collaboratively
- Implements quickly

**Feature requests:**
- Users know what they need
- Request new capabilities
- Community votes on priority
- Volunteer developers build
- Everyone benefits

## Vision for the Future (5-6 min)

**Near term (6-12 months):**
- Expanded prompt library (50+ validated prompts)
- More specialty-specific resources
- Better tools for prompt creation
- Growing community
- More institutions adopting
- Evidence base building

**Medium term (1-3 years):**
- Physician-led AI tool ecosystem
- Integration with major EMRs
- Research demonstrating impact
- Institutional adoption as standard
- Reduced documentation burden measurably
- Physician burnout improving
- Community of thousands

**Long term (3-10 years):**
- Documentation burden no longer a crisis
- AI assistance standard practice
- Physicians controlling the tools
- Open source as the model
- Not just documentation—education, research, decision support
- All physician-controlled, transparent, free

**The bigger vision:**
- Physician autonomy restored
- Technology serving physicians, not vice versa
- Open source as healthcare standard
- Community-driven innovation
- Better patient care through better physician wellbeing

**What success looks like:**
- No physician working until midnight on notes
- Documentation time cut in half
- Burnout rates declining
- Physicians staying in practice longer
- Better work-life balance
- More time for actual patient care

**Why this matters:**
- Every hour saved is an hour with family
