    Jaundice Assessment: Visual inspection suggests zone 3 jaundice (mid-abdomen). Transcutaneous bilirubin measurement: 12.4 mg/dL at 72 hours of life.

    Assessment:
    1. Healthy term newborn, 3 days old, doing well
    2. Physiologic jaundice - moderate level, monitoring indicated
    3. Breastfeeding, adequate intake based on output and weight loss
    4. Weight loss 3.1% (acceptable range)

    Plan:
    1. Jaundice management:
       - Plotted on Bhutani nomogram: currently in low-intermediate risk zone
       - Continue frequent breastfeeding (8-12 times per 24 hours)
       - Repeat bilirubin level in 24 hours
       - Educate parents on signs of worsening jaundice (below umbilicus, palms/soles)
       - Increase vigilance for lethargy, poor feeding

    2. Nutrition:
       - Continue exclusive breastfeeding on demand
       - Lactation support: reviewed proper latch and positioning
       - Continue vitamin D 400 IU daily
       - Expect weight gain to start by day 5-7
       - Goal to regain birth weight by 2 weeks of age

    3. Preventive care:
       - Next visit in 2-3 days for weight check and bilirubin recheck
       - Hepatitis B vaccine #2 at 1-2 months
       - Newborn screening results will be available in 1-2 weeks (will call with results)
       - Hearing screen passed - no further testing needed

    4. Safety and anticipatory guidance:
       - Safe sleep: back to sleep, firm mattress, no loose bedding
       - Car seat use reviewed
       - Umbilical cord care: keep dry, fold diaper below cord
       - Bathing: Sponge baths until cord falls off (usually 1-2 weeks)
       - Temperature taking and when to call for fever (≥100.4°F rectal)

    5. Red flags to watch for:
       - Fever ≥100.4°F rectal
       - Lethargy, difficult to arouse
       - Poor feeding, refusing feeds
       - Decreased wet diapers (<6 per day after day 5)
       - Worsening jaundice (yellowing below umbilicus, palms/soles)
       - Vomiting (especially bilious or forceful)
       - Breathing difficulties

    Parents verbalized understanding and had opportunity to ask questions. Provided with after-visit summary and emergency contact numbers. Follow-up visit scheduled in 2 days.
