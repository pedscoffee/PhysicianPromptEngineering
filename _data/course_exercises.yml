    - Distinguish between facts and interpretations
    - Indicate uncertainty appropriately
    - Suggest what additional information might be needed
  example_good_prompt: |
    Create a pediatric SOAP note from this asthma visit transcript. Follow these guidelines:

    1. If vital information is missing (e.g., peak flow, medication doses), note "[not documented]" rather than inventing data
    2. Distinguish between objective findings and parental reports (use "mother reports..." vs "patient exhibits...")
    3. If severity assessment is ambiguous, state: "appears to be [mild/moderate/severe] based on [specific criteria]"
    4. In assessment, explicitly note any missing information that would be clinically relevant
    5. Use pediatric-appropriate language and include parent education in plan

  difficulty: "advanced"
  estimated_time: "30 minutes"
  transcript: "complex_multisystem"
  goal: "Create a prompt that can synthesize information across multiple visits or create continuity summaries"
  instructions: |
    Advanced practice requires summarizing longitudinal care. Create a prompt that can:
    - Synthesize information from multiple encounters
    - Track problem evolution over time
    - Create continuity summaries
    - Identify trends and changes
  example_good_prompt: |
    Create a CONTINUITY OF CARE SUMMARY for this complex patient.

    Purpose: Provide comprehensive overview for care transitions, referrals, or new providers

    STRUCTURE:

    1. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS
       - Age, key identifiers (no PHI if de-identified version)

    2. PROBLEM LIST (in order of clinical priority)
       For each problem include:
       - Diagnosis with date of onset/diagnosis
       - Current status (active acute, active chronic stable, active chronic unstable, resolved)
       - Key management points
       - Last assessment date

    3. CURRENT MEDICATIONS
       - List with doses, frequencies, indications
       - Recent changes highlighted

    4. RECENT CLINICAL COURSE
       - Summarize trajectory of active problems
       - Hospitalizations or ED visits
       - Significant test results with trends

    5. CARE TEAM & CONSULTANTS
       - Specialists involved
       - Care coordination needs

    6. UPCOMING NEEDS
       - Pending tests or referrals
       - Overdue preventive care
       - Scheduled procedures

    7. GOALS OF CARE
       - Patient's priorities
       - Treatment goals
       - Advanced directives status

    8. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS
       - Relevant social factors affecting care
       - Support system
       - Barriers to care

    FORMAT:
    - Concise but comprehensive (1-2 pages)
    - Easy to scan quickly
    - Highlights what's most important for safe care
    - Suitable for handoff, referral, or transition

    CLINICAL SYNTHESIS:
    Show clinical thinking about how problems relate to each other and overall trajectory.
    This should read as a thoughtful summary, not just a data dump.
