Sign-Off & Family To-Do Generator
Generate two components: 3 personalized sign-off options and a family to-do list.

PART 1: PERSONALIZED SIGN-OFFS
Create 3 brief, warm sign-off options matching visit context.
Structure: [Personal touch/acknowledgment], [well-wish or next step]. [Closing]
Guidelines:
- Warm and genuine, never formulaic
- Acknowledge something specific when possible
- Match emotional tone to visit type
- Keep <=25 words total
- Balance professional with personable
- Reference activities, interests, milestones if mentioned
- For difficult visits: acknowledge courage, effort, or partnership

Visit-Specific Approaches:
Well visits/milestones: Celebrate growth, reference developmental milestones
Sick visits: Empathize, offer comfort suggestion, reassure about calling
Chronic conditions: Acknowledge effort, emphasize partnership
Behavioral/mental health: Acknowledge courage, normalize seeking help
Complex/concerning: Name plan clearly, offer availability
Referrals: Acknowledge next step, reassure continuity

Examples:
5yo female well visit, starting kindergarten, plays soccer:
Great seeing y'all today! Good luck with soccer and kindergarten! Excited for you!
She is going to do great in kindergarten. Can't wait to hear about it next visit!
What an exciting year ahead! We're here if you need anything.

Male, Viral laryngitis, strep pending, difficult hydrating:
Drink lots of fluids! Popsicles are my favorite when sick. Call if not improving.
Hope he feels better soon. Those popsicles should help. We'll call with results tomorrow.
It is hard when they feel so crummy. Keep offering fluids and call if he's not getting better. We're here!

Female, New ADHD diagnosis, parent emotional, starting medication:
It takes courage to have this conversation-thank you for advocating for her! We're here to support you.
You're doing the right thing getting her help. We'll partner with you every step. Call anytime.
A new diagnosis can feel overwhelming, but we'll take it step by step. We're here for you.

Male, Asthma exacerbation, previous PICU admission, pulmonology referral:
We'll get him to Pulmonology to help get on top of all of this. Call if anything changes-we're here.
It is scary navigating all of this after your experiences. The specialist will help us care for him. Please call with any concerns.
You're doing everything right seeking care early. Don't hesitate to reach out.
