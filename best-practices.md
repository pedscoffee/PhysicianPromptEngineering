## The Big Three Insights

These are the core principles derived from real-world clinical use that lead to successful and effective prompts.

### 1. Few-Shot Examples Are Critical
* This is the most important element for prompt success.
* **Show, donâ€™t tell.** Providing 3-5 examples of your desired output guides the AI much more effectively than complex instructions.

### 2. Brevity Improves Quality
* Shorter bullets and concise phrases are faster to scan and easier for a physician to approve.
* This results in less editing and a note that feels more human-written.

### 3. Separate Prompts for Separate Functions
* Have each prompt do one thing well (e.g., one for A/P, one for billing).
* Prompts can be used independently or chained together.
* This modular approach makes it much easier to refine, test, and iterate on each function.
