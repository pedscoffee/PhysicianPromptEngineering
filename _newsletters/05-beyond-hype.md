# Let's Talk About AI Hype (And Reality)

I get this question constantly: *"Isn't AI just going to hallucinate and make dangerous mistakes?"*

Fair question. Let me give you the honest answer, not the marketing spin.

## What AI Actually Does

Think of modern AI like autocorrect on steroids. It's pattern recognition, not intelligence.

When you use a prompt to format your Assessment & Plan, the AI isn't "thinking" about your patient. It's recognizing patterns in your examples and applying them to new text.

Just like spell check doesn't "understand" language—it just knows "teh" should probably be "the."

**This is good news.** It means AI is a tool you control, not a colleague making independent decisions.

## The 90-95% Rule

Here's what I've learned from hundreds of physicians using these prompts:

AI gets documentation formatting right about 90-95% of the time. The other 5-10%? That's why you review every note before signing.

You're not replacing clinical judgment. You're automating the formatting and organization of information you've already gathered.

## What About Hallucinations?

Yes, AI can "hallucinate" (make up information). But here's the thing: it doesn't happen when you're asking it to *format* existing content.

Hallucinations occur when you ask AI to generate new clinical information from scratch. Our prompts don't do that. They reorganize, condense, and format text from your AI scribe.

Big difference.

## The Real Risk

The actual danger isn't hallucinations—it's over-reliance. The risk is signing a note without reading it because you trust the AI too much.

That's why every tool on this site emphasizes: **You review. You approve. You're responsible.**

AI handles the tedious formatting. You handle the clinical decisions. That division of labor works.

## What This Means for You

Stop thinking of AI as artificial intelligence. Think of it as automated formatting.

You wouldn't refuse to use spell check because it might miss something. You just review its suggestions. Same principle.

## Next Week

I'll share a community spotlight—a pediatrician who created a prompt that cut her after-visit summary time from 10 minutes to 90 seconds. Her prompt is now used by 50+ physicians across three specialties.

This is what community-driven development looks like.

Until then,
