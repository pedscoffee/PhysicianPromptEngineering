# Master Prompt Engineering in 6 Hours

For the past 9 weeks, I've been sending you bite-sized lessons on prompt engineering. You've learned the principles, tried the tools, seen community examples.

Today, I'm introducing something more comprehensive: The Interactive Course.

It's a complete training program that takes you from beginner to advanced prompt engineer through hands-on practice with real clinical scenarios.

**No signup required. No cost. Privacy-first (runs in your browser).**

## What You'll Learn

**Module 1: Fundamentals** (60 min)
- The science of few-shot learning
- Why examples beat instructions
- Building your first clinical prompt

**Module 2: Context & Clarity** (75 min)
- Task statements that work
- Format rules hierarchy
- Handling edge cases

**Module 3: Advanced Techniques** (90 min)
- Conditional logic (diagnosis-based triggers)
- Meta-prompting (using AI to create prompts)
- Multi-stage refinement

**Module 4: Safety & Best Practices** (45 min)
- Clinical responsibility frameworks
- Quality assurance protocols
- Documentation audit trails

**Module 5: Specialty Applications** (90 min)
- Real-world case studies across specialties
- Final project: Build a complete specialty-specific prompt library

## How It Works

**Hands-on exercises, not lectures**
Write actual prompts for real (de-identified) clinical scenarios. No passive video watching.

**AI-powered feedback**
Submit your work and get instant, specific feedback on what's working and what needs improvement. Like having a prompt engineering tutor available 24/7.

**Progressive difficulty**
Starts simple (basic A&P formatting) and builds to complex (multi-condition management, specialty-specific workflows).

**Your pace**
Complete it in a weekend or spread it across weeks. Progress saves in your browser.

**Certificate upon completion**
Useful for CME documentation (though not formally accredited—yet).

## What Physicians Say

**Dr. Michael Torres (hospitalist):**
*"I thought I knew prompt engineering from using ChatGPT casually. Module 3 completely changed how I approach clinical prompts. The conditional logic section alone was worth the 6 hours."*

**Dr. Jennifer Wu (family medicine):**
*"The hands-on exercises with real scenarios made it click. I wasn't just reading theory—I was actually building prompts and seeing immediate feedback on why they worked or didn't."*

## Start Today

If you've been following these newsletters, you already know the fundamentals. Jump straight to Module 3 for advanced techniques.

If you're new or want the complete foundation, start at Module 1.

## System Requirements

Works on Chrome/Edge/Safari. The AI feedback feature requires a one-time model download (~2GB). After that, everything runs locally in your browser—no data leaves your device.

Plan for 5-10 minutes of initial setup, then instant loading thereafter.

## The Goal

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:
- Create custom prompts for any clinical scenario
- Troubleshoot when prompts don't work
- Build a complete specialty-specific prompt library
- Train colleagues on effective prompt engineering

That's the skill set that saves hours weekly, not just minutes.

## Coming Up

Next week: Safety and compliance deep dive. How to implement AI-assisted documentation while maintaining clinical responsibility, HIPAA compliance, and institutional approval.

This is the conversation about risk management that every physician needs to have before scaling these tools across their practice.

Until then,

P.S. The course includes a community discussion forum. If you get stuck on an exercise, ask for help. If you discover a better approach, share it. This is collaborative learning.
