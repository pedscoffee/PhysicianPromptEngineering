# Welcome to Physician Prompt Engineering

Thanks for joining our community of physicians who are taking back their time—one prompt at a time.

If you're like most doctors, you spend 2-3 hours per day on documentation. That's time you could be spending with patients, with family, or doing literally anything other than clicking boxes and typing notes.

Here's the truth: AI scribes are great at capturing conversations, but they produce generic, verbose notes that still require extensive editing. You didn't trade medical school for becoming a professional note editor.

**That's where we come in.**

We've built a library of physician-tested prompts that transform raw AI scribe output into concise, personalized documentation—in your exact style. No manual editing required.

## Your First Win: The A&P Prompt

The single most valuable prompt in our library is the Assessment & Plan formatter. It converts rambling AI paragraphs into problem-oriented documentation that takes seconds to review instead of minutes to rewrite.

Physicians report saving 2-5 minutes per patient encounter with this one prompt alone.

**Try it today:**

## What to Expect

Over the coming weeks, I'll share:
- Proven prompt templates you can use immediately
- The science behind what makes prompts work
- Tools to organize and customize your prompt library
- Stories from physicians who've reclaimed hours of their lives

Every email will be concise and actionable. No fluff, no hype—just practical solutions.

**Your move:** Copy the A&P prompt and test it on your next patient note. Time how long it takes to review versus your usual editing process.

Looking forward to helping you document less and practice more,
