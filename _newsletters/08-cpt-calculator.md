# Stop Undercoding Your Complexity

Let's talk about something most physicians hate: billing.

Specifically, figuring out whether that patient encounter was a 99214 or 99215. Or whether the medical decision-making (MDM) really supports the level you're choosing.

Here's the truth: Most physicians undercode. Not because they're being humble, but because MDM calculation is tedious and we're all rushing to the next patient.

**That ends today.**

## Meet the E&M Calculator

It's a browser-based tool that analyzes your note and tells you:
- Number and complexity of problems addressed
- Amount and complexity of data reviewed
- Risk level of management decisions
- Recommended CPT code based on 2021+ E&M guidelines

Takes 30 seconds. Free to use. No account required.

## Why This Matters

A colleague recently showed me her notes from the past month. She'd coded everything as 99213 (routine complexity).

We ran 10 of her notes through the calculator. Seven were actually 99214s. Three were 99215s.

**Her comment:** *"I'm leaving thousands of dollars on the table because I don't want to spend time calculating MDM."*

She's not alone. The 2021 E&M changes made coding more objective, but most physicians still guess based on time or gut feeling.

## How It Works

1. **Paste your note** (or key elements: diagnoses, data reviewed, treatment plan)
2. **Calculator analyzes:** Counts problems, categorizes complexity, assesses risk
3. **Get results:** MDM level (straightforward, low, moderate, high) + recommended CPT code
4. **See the math:** Detailed breakdown showing exactly why it suggested that level

Most physicians spend longer deciding what to order for lunch.

## Real Example

Patient with uncontrolled diabetes (A1c 9.2), new hypertension, and obesity.

**Physician's initial code:** 99213
**Calculator recommendation:** 99215

Why? Multiple chronic conditions with poor control + reviewed lab data + moderate risk management (medication adjustments, lifestyle counseling) = high complexity MDM.

That's an extra $70-90 per encounter depending on payer. Over a year? Significant revenue difference.

## Compliance Note

The calculator helps you code accurately—not maximally. It follows CMS guidelines exactly.

You still review the recommendation and make the final decision. But now that decision is based on objective criteria, not guesswork.

## Pro Tip: Use It Retroactively

Pull a random week of your charts. Run 10-15 through the calculator. See if there's a pattern of undercoding.

If there is, you haven't been billing for the complexity you're actually providing. That's fixable going forward.

**Important:** Document the MDM elements (problems, data, risk) clearly in your note. The calculator works best when you've explicitly stated what you reviewed and considered.

## Coming Up

Next week: Specialty focus. I'll show you how to customize prompts for different medical specialties—because a cardiology H&P looks nothing like a pediatric well-child visit.

Plus, we'll feature specialty-specific prompts from the community library.

Until then,

P.S. The calculator includes educational tooltips explaining the 2021 MDM guidelines. If you never fully learned the new system, this is a painless way to get up to speed.
