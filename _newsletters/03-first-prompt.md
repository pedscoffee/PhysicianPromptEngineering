# Build Your First Custom Prompt in 10 Minutes

You've learned the three principles. Now let's put them to work.

Today, I'm walking you through our Prompt Generator—an interactive tool that builds custom Assessment & Plan prompts tailored to your exact documentation style.

No technical skills required. Just answer a few questions and get a production-ready prompt.

## Why This Matters

Generic prompts save time. But prompts customized to YOUR preferences? That's when you stop editing entirely.

Here's what you'll customize:
- **Format:** APSO, SOAP, problem-list, or your preferred structure
- **Detail level:** Comprehensive vs concise (most choose concise)
- **Tone:** Clinical precision, patient-friendly, or academic
- **Specialty:** Tailored examples for your practice area

The generator creates a prompt with 3-5 examples in your exact style, following the principles from last week.

## How It Works

1. **Choose your format** → Select how you organize A&P sections
2. **Set preferences** → Detail level, tone, specialty focus
3. **Review examples** → The tool generates 3 sample notes in your style
4. **Copy & use** → Your custom prompt is ready in under 10 minutes

Most physicians spend longer debating what to order for lunch.

## Real Results

Dr. Sarah Chen (pediatrics) built hers in 8 minutes. Her review time dropped from 4 minutes per note to 30 seconds:

*"I went from re-writing entire paragraphs to just confirming accuracy. The prompt captured my problem-oriented style perfectly."*

## Pro Tip: Save It Somewhere

Once you've generated your prompt, you'll want it handy for every patient encounter. Next week, I'll introduce the Snippet Manager—a privacy-first tool that stores your prompts locally (no accounts, no servers, completely HIPAA-compliant).

For now, bookmark your custom prompt or paste it into a note.

See you next week,

P.S. The generator includes a preview feature. Test your prompt on sample notes before using it live—no patient data required.
