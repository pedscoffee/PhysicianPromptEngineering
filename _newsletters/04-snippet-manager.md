# Stop Losing Your Best Prompts

Quick question: Where's that great prompt you created last week?

Is it buried in a Word doc? Scattered across sticky notes? Living in your EMR's text expander with a cryptic abbreviation you can't remember?

If you've built up a collection of working prompts (and you should have by now), you need a system to organize them.

## Meet the Snippet Manager

It's a browser-based tool that stores and organizes your prompt library. Here's what makes it different:

**No accounts, no servers, no risk**
Everything stays in your browser's local storage. We never see your prompts. Ever. It's completely HIPAA-compliant because nothing leaves your computer.

**Organize by category**
- Clinical (A&P, HPI, ROS)
- Administrative (billing, referrals)
- Patient-facing (instructions, summaries)
- Custom categories you create

**Search and copy instantly**
Type "asthma" and find your asthma action plan template in seconds. One-click copy to clipboard.

## How Physicians Use It

**Dr. James Rodriguez (family medicine):**
24 prompts organized by visit type (well-child, acute, chronic care). He estimates it saves him 30 seconds per encounter just in retrieval time.

**Dr. Lisa Park (hospitalist):**
Separate categories for admission, progress notes, discharge summaries. "I used to have these in different files. Now they're all searchable in one place."

## Get Started in 5 Minutes

1. Open the Snippet Manager
2. Import your existing prompts (or start fresh)
3. Add categories and tags
4. Search, copy, use

That's it. No tutorials needed.

## Privacy Note

Some physicians ask: "Is this safe?"

Everything in Snippet Manager is stored locally in your browser using the same technology as your browser's bookmark system. We can't access it. Your IT department can't access it. It never touches the internet unless you explicitly export a backup.

If you clear your browser data, you'll lose your snippets—so use the export feature to save a backup file.

## Coming Up

Next week: I'm addressing the elephant in the room. "Is AI going to replace doctors?" "What about hallucinations?" "Can I really trust this?"

Let's talk about the hype versus reality of AI in clinical practice.

Until then,

P.S. The Snippet Manager works on mobile too. Great for pulling up prompts during rounds.
