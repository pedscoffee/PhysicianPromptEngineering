# Pediatrics Isn't Cardiology Isn't Surgery

Generic prompts save time. But specialty-specific prompts? That's when things get really efficient.

Today, I'm showing you how to adapt the core principles to your specific practice—whether you're a pediatrician documenting growth curves or a surgeon outlining operative plans.

## Why Specialty Matters

A pediatric well-child visit includes:
- Growth percentiles
- Developmental milestones
- Anticipatory guidance by age
- Vaccine schedules

A cardiology consultation includes:
- Detailed cardiovascular exam
- EKG interpretation
- Medication reconciliation
- Risk stratification

These aren't just different content—they require different documentation structures entirely.

## The Adaptation Formula

Here's how to customize any prompt for your specialty:

**1. Keep the core principles**
- Few-shot examples (3-5)
- Brevity focus
- One purpose per prompt

**2. Change the examples**
Replace generic examples with real cases from your specialty. The AI learns your specialty's patterns.

**3. Add specialty-specific elements**
- Pediatrics: Include growth chart format preferences
- Surgery: Add procedure-specific terminology
- Cardiology: Specify how to present echo/cath findings
- Psychiatry: Structure mental status exam format

**4. Adjust the terminology**
Use your specialty's language. "Patient" vs "client," "chief complaint" vs "presenting problem"—these matter for output quality.

## Specialty Library Highlights

Here are the most downloaded specialty-specific prompts from our community:

**Pediatrics:**
- Well-child visit summaries (Elena's prompt from Week 6!)
- Anticipatory guidance by age
- Growth/development documentation

**Family Medicine:**
- Chronic disease management
- Preventive care documentation
- Multi-problem visits

**Internal Medicine/Hospital Medicine:**
- Admission H&Ps
- Daily progress notes
- Discharge summaries

**Surgery:**
- Operative notes
- Pre-op assessments
- Post-op instructions

## Case Study: Dr. Rachel Foster (Cardiology)

Rachel started with the generic A&P prompt. It worked, but it didn't capture the nuances of cardiology documentation.

She adapted it:
- Added examples with NYHA classification
- Included EKG interpretation format
- Structured medication sections (anti-arrhythmics, anticoagulation, etc.)
- Added risk scoring language (CHADS-VASC, etc.)

**Result:** Her notes now read exactly like she'd written them manually—but in 10% of the time.

She shared her adapted prompt. Now 30+ cardiologists use her template.

## Your Assignment

Take one of the core prompts (A&P, HPI, patient instructions) and adapt it for your specialty:

1. Replace the generic examples with 3 cases from your practice
2. Add one specialty-specific element
3. Test it on 5 patients
4. Refine based on results

**Then share it.** Your specialty colleagues need it.

P.S. Specialty adaptation works for tools too. The E&M Calculator handles specialty-specific MDM considerations (psychiatry time-based coding, preventive visits, etc.). Worth exploring for your particular specialty.
