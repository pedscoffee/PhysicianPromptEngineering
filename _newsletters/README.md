## Newsletter Best Practices

Based on 2025 healthcare email marketing research:

### Subject Lines
- **Length:** 40-60 characters (optimal for mobile)
- **Style:** Problem-focused or benefit-focused
- **Avoid:** "Reminder" language, spam triggers

### Content Structure
- **Opening:** Hook within first 8 seconds of reading
- **Length:** 300-500 words (concise, scannable)
- **Tone:** Professional but conversational, physician-to-physician
- **CTAs:** 1-2 clear calls-to-action per email

### Timing & Frequency
- **Recommended:** Weekly or biweekly for this 12-part series
- **Then:** Monthly for ongoing updates
- **Avoid:** Over-mailing (leads to unsubscribes)

### Mobile Optimization
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Clear headers for scanning
- Single-column layout
- Large, tappable CTAs

## Writing Style Guidelines

Match the established site voice:

✅ **Do:**
- Use "you" and "we" (conversational)
- Lead with physician pain points
- Provide specific time-saving metrics
- Include real examples (de-identified)
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- End with clear next steps

❌ **Don't:**
- Use marketing hype or superlatives
- Make unrealistic promises
- Include heavy jargon or technical terms
- Write long paragraphs
- Skip the practical application
- Overuse emojis (use heroicons sparingly instead)

## Heroicons Usage

When using icons, use Heroicons (not emojis):

```html
<!-- Example: Checkmark -->
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;">
  <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="m4.5 12.75 6 6 9-13.5" />
</svg>
```

Use sparingly—only when it adds clarity, not decoration.

## Personalization Variables

Standard Jekyll/Liquid variables you can use:

```liquid
{{ site.baseurl }}       # For internal links
{{ site.title }}         # Site name
{{ site.author }}        # Your name
```

## Metrics to Track

Monitor these email metrics:

- **Open Rate:** Healthcare average is 23.46% (aim for 25%+)
- **Click-Through Rate:** Healthcare average is 3.62% (aim for 5%+)
- **Unsubscribe Rate:** Keep below 0.5%
- **Tool Usage:** Track clicks on specific CTAs (Snippet Manager, Course, etc.)

## Customization Notes

Each newsletter includes:
- **Front matter:** Title, subject line, newsletter number
- **Structured sections:** Clear headers for scanning
- **Multiple CTAs:** Primary (main action) + secondary (related resources)
- **Personal signature:** Maintains physician-to-physician tone

## Distribution Platform

These newsletters are written for **Substack** (your current platform), but can be adapted for:
- MailerLite
- ConvertKit
- SendGrid
- Any email marketing platform supporting markdown/HTML

## A/B Testing Ideas

Consider testing:
- **Subject lines:** Question vs benefit statement
- **CTA placement:** Above fold vs end of email
- **Length:** 300 words vs 500 words
- **Time of day:** Morning vs evening sends
- **Day of week:** Tuesday/Wednesday typically perform best for healthcare
