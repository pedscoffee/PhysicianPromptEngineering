# The Two-Stage Workflow That Changes Everything

You've got the prompts. You understand the principles. But how does this actually work in your daily workflow?

Let me walk you through the system that makes it all click.

## The Problem with AI Scribes Alone

Most physicians use AI scribes like this:
1. Have conversation with patient
2. AI generates a note
3. Spend 5-10 minutes editing and reorganizing
4. Sign and move on

You've traded dictation time for editing time. Better than typing from scratch, but still frustrating.

## The Two-Stage Solution

Here's what changes the game:

**Stage 1: Ambient Intelligence (Your AI Scribe)**
Captures the conversation. Produces raw, verbose output. This part you already have.

**Stage 2: Personalized Refinement (Your Custom Prompts)**
Takes that raw output and transforms it into YOUR documentation style in seconds.

Most EMRs (Epic, Cerner, etc.) now have "Generate with AI" buttons built in. You paste your prompt, feed it the scribe output, and get back a formatted note that matches your preferences.

No editing. Just review and sign.

## Real Example: A Typical Workflow

Dr. Sarah Kim (family medicine) walks me through her process:

**Morning huddle:** Reviews schedule
**Patient encounter:** Normal conversation, AI scribe recording
**Immediately after:** Opens patient chart
- AI scribe output appears (verbose, 400 words)
- Clicks "Generate with AI" in A&P section
- Pastes her custom A&P prompt + scribe output
- Gets back organized, concise note (150 words)
- Reviews for accuracy (30 seconds)
- Signs note

**Time elapsed:** 90 seconds total documentation time.

Previously: 4-6 minutes of manual editing.

## The Key Insight

Stage 1 (AI scribe) captures *what* happened.
Stage 2 (custom prompts) formats *how* you document.

You need both. One without the other is incomplete.

## Getting Started

If you don't have an AI scribe yet, talk to your EMR team about built-in AI features. Most major systems added them in the last 18 months.

If you have a scribe but it's producing notes that need heavy editing, the problem isn't the scribe—it's the lack of Stage 2 refinement.

That's where custom prompts come in.

## Common Questions

**Q: What if my EMR doesn't have AI text generation?**
A: You can use the scribe output with free AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and copy-paste the result back. Not as seamless, but still faster than manual editing.

**Q: Do I need different prompts for different note sections?**
A: Yes. One for A&P, one for HPI, one for patient instructions. Remember: modular beats multi-purpose.

**Q: How do I know if my prompt is working?**
A: Test it on 5-10 encounters. If you're still editing paragraphs, the prompt needs refinement. If you're just confirming accuracy, you've got it dialed in.

## Next Week

I'll introduce the E&M Calculator—a tool that analyzes your medical decision-making complexity and suggests appropriate CPT codes.

Because saving time on documentation is great. Getting paid correctly for your complexity is even better.

Until then,

P.S. The best part about this workflow? You can implement it on one patient tomorrow. No need to change your entire practice overnight. Start small, build confidence, scale up.
