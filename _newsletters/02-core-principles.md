# The 3 Principles That Make Prompts Work

Last week, I asked you to try the A&P prompt. If you did, you probably noticed something interesting: it works better than your attempts to "tell" the AI what you want.

There's a reason for that.

Most physicians approach prompting like writing instructions to a resident. They explain what they want, add more details when it doesn't work, and end up with a 500-word prompt that produces mediocre results.

Here's what actually works:

## Principle #1: Examples Beat Instructions

Instead of explaining what you want, show 3-5 examples of your preferred output format. The AI learns from patterns, not paragraphs.

**Don't write:** "Please create a concise problem-oriented assessment and plan organized by diagnosis..."

**Do write:** Three actual notes in your style, then "Format like these examples."

## Principle #2: Brevity Improves Quality

Concise notes are easier to review, easier to scan, and paradoxically—easier for AI to generate correctly. Brief prompts produce brief, accurate outputs.

The sweet spot: 150-300 words total for most clinical prompts.

## Principle #3: One Prompt, One Purpose

Trying to make a single "master prompt" that handles everything? That's why it keeps breaking.

Instead, create modular prompts:
- One for A&P formatting
- One for billing analysis
- One for patient instructions
- One for quality metrics

Specialized beats multi-purpose, every time.

## See It In Action

We've documented these principles with before/after examples, clinical use cases, and the cognitive science behind why they work.

## This Week's Challenge

Take one of your existing prompts (or create a new one) and apply these three principles:
1. Replace instructions with 3 examples
2. Cut it to under 300 words
3. Make it do ONE thing really well

Test it on five patient encounters and note the difference.

Next week: I'll show you exactly how to build your first custom prompt from scratch, step by step.

Until then,
