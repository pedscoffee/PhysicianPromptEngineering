# Community Spotlight: Dr. Elena Martinez

This week, I want to share a story that captures why this community exists.

Dr. Elena Martinez is a pediatrician in Austin. She was spending 10 minutes after each well-child visit writing anticipatory guidance—age-appropriate safety tips, developmental milestones, nutrition advice.

Ten minutes. Every single patient.

She thought: *There has to be a better way.*

## The Problem

AI scribes captured the conversation, but the output was verbose and generic. Parents needed specific, actionable guidance for their child's age. Elena needed it organized by topic (safety, nutrition, development, etc.) in clear, parent-friendly language.

She tried the generic prompts. Too formal. Not specific enough. Not *her* voice.

## The Solution

Elena spent 30 minutes creating a custom prompt with examples from her actual after-visit summaries. She included:
- 5 examples of her preferred format
- Age-specific template sections (2-month, 6-month, 12-month, etc.)
- Tone guidelines ("conversational but authoritative")
- Organization preferences (bullets, not paragraphs)

First test: 90 seconds from AI scribe output to finalized summary.

She couldn't believe it. Neither could her colleagues.

## What Happened Next

Elena shared her prompt on our contribution page. Within two weeks:
- 50+ physicians downloaded it
- 12 customized it for their specialties (pediatrics, family medicine, OB)
- 3 improved it with additional age ranges
- The updated version went back into the library

This is community-driven development in action.

## The Ripple Effect

Elena's 30-minute investment created 50+ hours of time savings for other physicians. That's the power of sharing knowledge.

Imagine if 100 physicians contributed their best prompt. 1,000 physicians would save thousands of hours collectively.

That's not just efficiency. That's reducing burnout at scale.

## Coming Up

Next week: The two-stage workflow that changed everything. How to integrate AI scribes with custom prompts for fully automated, preference-matched documentation.

It's the implementation framework that makes all of this work in real clinical practice.

Until then,

P.S. Elena mentioned something interesting: She initially hesitated to share because she thought her prompt was "too simple." Turns out, simple is exactly what works. Don't overthink it—if it saves you time, it'll save others time too.
