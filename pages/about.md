Project Overview
A New Way Forward
Key innovation shared here is physician use of a large language model as a personalized AI Editor to accelerate and enhance medical documentation.
Natural conversation --> AI Scribe --> AI Editor --> Your Final Note
Goal: Transform AI scribe output into your exact preferences using EMR‚Äôs internal LLM. Notes should be fully automated to your exact preferences with no editing required.
While it is tempting to take this in all sorts of directions; I recommend starting with a goal of creating notes that are indistinguishable from your current handwritten notes but are fully automatic. That way you can start to reap the benefits immediately.
Three Production Prompts:
A/P Formatting ‚Äì Transforms paragraphs into concise, problem-oriented notes
Billing Analysis ‚Äì Assesses MDM and suggests CPT codes with audit trail
AVS Generation ‚Äì Creates personalized sign-offs + family to-do lists
Key Constraint: Epic EMR LLM only accepts plain text (no markdown, no rich formatting). All prompts must be ‚â§5,000 characters.
These prompts were made to work with Epic‚Äôs Generate Text with AI feature. This same workflow could be done with other LLMs and not necessarily inside the EMR (and probably more successfully!) but be sure that whatever you‚Äôre using is approved by your IT department and safe for HIPAA.

Physician Prompt Engineering
The Big Three Insights
Few-shot examples are critical
Most important element for prompt success
Show, don‚Äôt tell ‚Äì examples guide output better than instructions
Brevity improves quality
Shorter bullets = faster scanning, easier approval
Less editing required, more human-feeling
Separate prompts for separate functions
Each prompt does one thing well
Can be used independently or together
Easier to refine and iterate
Key Success Factors
Match your natural style ‚Äì Don‚Äôt force unfamiliar formats
Build test library early ‚Äì Deidentified transcripts can greatly speed iteration while improving prompts
Iterate scientifically ‚Äì Change one thing at a time, test thoroughly
Real-world testing reveals value ‚Äì Be open to unexpected benefits

Example Output:

2
3
4
5
6
**Viral URI**

*Recommended supportive care with OTC medications...*
2. Billing Analysis v1.2
Purpose: Assess MDM components and suggest CPT E/M codes with detailed reasoning
Character Count: 4,951 / 5,000
Status: Exceeding expectations ‚Äì valuable audit trail
Key Features:
Evaluates Problems, Data, Risk per 2021 E/M guidelines
Applies 2-of-3 rule
Handles modifier 25 for well visits
Provides traceable reasoning for audits
Example Output:
1
2
3
4
5
Problems: Moderate (systemic symptoms)
Data: Moderate (test ordered)
Risk: Moderate (prescription antibiotic)
2-of-3 Analysis: All 3 meet Moderate. Overall=Moderate.
Final Code: 99214
3. AVS Generation v1.0
Purpose: Generate personalized sign-offs + actionable family to-do lists
Character Count: 4,715 / 5000
Status: Working well in testing, ready for production use
Key Features:
Three sign-off options (‚â§25 words each)
Visit-specific acknowledgment
Actionable-only to-do list
Complements EMR‚Äôs auto-population
Example Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
Great seeing y'all today! Good luck with soccer and kindergarten!
 
To-Do List:
Tests/Results:
  - Strep test: Results pending, we will call tomorrow
Appointments:
  - Return to clinic if no improvement in 7 days
AI Scribe Configuration
Current Settings:
Output: One paragraph per diagnosis
Multiple problems: Numbered (1., 2., 3.)
Filtering: Minimal (let LLM refine)
Rationale: Reduces susceptibility to scribe prompt drift
Testing & Validation
Test Transcript Library
HIPAA compliance is a must
Current Size: 50+ deidentified cases
Coverage: Sick visits, well visits, chronic conditions, complex cases, newborns
Critical Insight: More important than initially thought ‚Äì enables rapid validation especially once broad enough to capture full array of common visits and different edge cases
Testing Protocol for New Prompts
Test through entire transcript library first
Iterate as appropriate
Once ready, incorporate into real work day and see how it fits into overall workflow
Ongoing iterative improvement and edge case identification
Edge cases do not all need to be addressed to have a successful prompt. They are valuable to identify, but all of this work assumes a physician in the loop. Creating a tool that covers the most common situations is still incredibly useful so long as the physician using the prompts understands the edge cases when the tool may miss something. This is similar to how in the old way of doing things physicians should have been very familiar with their dot phrases so that they would know when something in the boiler plate text would need to be changed.
Common Issues & Solutions
A/P Formatting
Problem: Format not as intended
Fix: Check few shot examples, if one of them is even slightly off target it will throw the pattern matching out of whack
Billing Analysis
Problem: Physician disagrees with intended code
Use as flag: Often indicates documentation is missing a detail
Remember: Primary value of the billing prompt is quick documentation of why a code was chosen, not intended for absolute accuracy. If a part of the coding is incorrect just change it quickly and move on. I think you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised how well it preforms though üòÄ
AVS Generation
Problem: Tone mismatch between visit and sign offs generated
Fix: Adjust few shot examples to better match your voice, consider using additional time gained from previous steps in work flow to personalize it even more
Personal Project Version History
Version 2.2 ‚Äì Current
All three prompts (A/P, Billing, and AVS) in production
Billing exceeding expectations
AVS ready for clinic use
Test library: 50+ transcripts
Anticipated Next Steps/Goals
Refine Gemini Gem to assist with prompt creation until it is ready to share publically
Continue to iterate on teaching ‚ÄúQuestions for Rounds‚Äù and metacognition prompts
Create opportunity on GitHub for public sharing of prompts amongst clinicians
Version 2.0 ‚Äì A/P breakthrough
‚ÄúPithy‚Äù format with extreme brevity
Felt like a ~50% cognitive load reduction during the work day; huge win
1,697 characters headroom
Version 1.0 ‚Äì Archived
Detailed format with section headers
May be preferred by some clinicians or for really complex visits
Few-shot examples established as critical
Quick Start for New Prompts
Define YOUR desired output first (hardest step)
Collect 3-5 examples of perfect notes in YOUR style
Create clear few-shot examples
Start simple
Few-shot examples do heavy lifting
Less instructions often equals better output as it is an easier pattern for the LLM to follow
Build test library early
Aim for 40+ deidentified transcripts
Include variety: sick, well, chronic, complex
Test extensively
Run through entire test library
Limit real clinic day use until feel comfortable with prompt‚Äôs typical output and confident task of reviewing output is better than writing from scratch
Iterate based on real-world use
Edge cases are normal
Refine based on patterns
