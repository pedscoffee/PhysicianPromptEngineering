All about Scribes
Step 1: Scribe Best Practices – Getting a Great First Draft
The entire “AI Editor” workflow on this site depends on one thing: a good “first draft” from an AI Scribe.
A great final note starts with a great transcript. This page covers the best practices for Step 1: The AI Scribe—what it is, how to use it, and what to look out for.
What is an Ambient Scribe?
An ambient scribe is a secure, HIPAA-compliant tool (often an app on your phone) that listens to your natural conversation with a patient and automatically transcribes it into a “first draft” of your clinical note.
Think of it as the first two steps in our new workflow:
Natural Conversation → AI Scribe (Listens & Transcribes) → AI Editor (Your Prompt) → Your Final Note
The scribe’s only job is to capture what was said. Your prompt’s job (Step 2) is to format that text into what you want it to look like.
Scribe Output vs. Your Final Note
Scribe Output (The “First Draft”): This is the raw text the scribe produces before you apply your prompts. It’s often a long, dense paragraph (or several) that summarizes the conversation. It’s accurate, but not scannable or formatted in your style.
Your Final Note (The “Edited” Note): This is what you get after you run one of the prompts from this site (like the “Pithy A/P” prompt) on the scribe’s output. It’s concise, problem-oriented, and formatted exactly to your preferences.
Your goal is not to get a perfect note from the scribe. Your goal is to get a complete and accurate “first draft” that your AI Editor prompt can perfectly reformat.
How to Get Good, Usable Transcripts
While you can often just talk normally, a few small habits can dramatically improve the quality of your scribe’s “first draft,” which leads to a better final note.
Get Clear Consent (and Reassure the Patient): Start the visit with a clear, simple script. This isn’t awkward; it’s a patient experience win because it shows them you’re focused on them, not your computer.“Is it okay with you if I record our conversation for their chart? It helps me not have to type as much while we talk.”
Summarize at the End: This is the single most effective trick. As you conclude the visit, provide a brief summary for the patient and family. This does two things: it confirms the plan for the family and gives the AI Scribe a perfect, clean summary to use for the Assessment and Plan.
Narrate Key Findings Out Loud: When you perform your exam, narrate pertinent positives and negatives. You’re not talking to the computer; you’re talking to the patient or parent. This practice is great for patient education and ensures your key findings make it into the note.
“Okay, I see the throat is erythematous with some exudate.”
“Lungs are clear, no wheezing or rhonchi.”
“I see four pearly papules with umbilicated centers on the left wrist.”
Don’t Stress About It: Honestly, most of the time you can just forget the scribe is on and have a normal conversation. It does a great job capturing the details. These tips just help it get from 95% to 99% accuracy.
Common Tools & The Non-Negotiable Security Rule
1. The #1 Rule: CHECK WITH IT/HIPAA FIRST Before you use any scribe tool, you must get approval from your institution’s IT, compliance, and/or legal departments. You are responsible for protecting patient health information (PHI).
2. NEVER Use Public AI Tools with PHI Do not copy-paste any patient information into public-facing AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. This is a massive HIPAA violation. The tools on this site are designed to be used inside your secure, EMR-integrated LLM (which protects the data) or with a HIPAA-compliant third-party tool.
3. Common Tools to Ask Your Institution About:
EMR-Native Tools: Many EMRs, like Epic, are rolling out their own integrated ambient scribe and LLM features (e.g., “Generate Text with AI”). These are often the most secure and best-integrated options.
Doximity: Doximity offers a free scribe tool. You still must verify with your IT department that its use is approved.
Other Third-Party Scribes: There are many other products on the market. Always go through your official institutional channels before using one.
