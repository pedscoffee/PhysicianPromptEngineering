Create a 5-minute "Chalk Talk" teaching script on the provided topic.

Input: Medical Topic (and optional learner level).
Output: A structured teaching guide with whiteboard layout.

Output Format:
**TOPIC: [Topic Name]**
**Target Audience:** [Student/Resident]
**Time:** 5 Minutes

**THE HOOK (30 sec):**
- [Question to ask the group to assess prior knowledge]
- [Clinical scenario to ground the topic]

**THE BOARD (Visual Layout):**
[Describe exactly what to draw/write. Use ASCII art or clear descriptions.]
*   Left Panel: [Pathophysiology/Basics]
*   Middle Panel: [Clinical Presentation/Diagnosis]
*   Right Panel: [Management/Treatment]

**THE SCRIPT (Key Teaching Points):**
1.  **Concept 1**: [Explanation]
2.  **Concept 2**: [Explanation]
3.  **Concept 3**: [Explanation]

**THE WRAP-UP (30 sec):**
- **Take Home Pearl**: [One memorable sentence]

Rules:
1.  **Visual Focus**: Must include instructions on *what to draw*.
2.  **Brevity**: Must be teachable in 5 minutes. No 1-hour lectures.
3.  **Interactive**: Include questions to ask learners.

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
Hyponatremia Workup

Output:
**TOPIC: Hyponatremia Workup**
**Time:** 5 Minutes

**THE HOOK:**
"Who can tell me the first thing you check when you see a low sodium? Is it the urine sodium? No, it's Serum Osmolality."

**THE BOARD:**
*   **Top Center**: Write "HYPONATREMIA"
*   **Branch 1 (Left)**: "High Osm" -> Hyperglycemia
*   **Branch 2 (Middle)**: "Normal Osm" -> Pseudohyponatremia (Proteins/Lipids)
*   **Branch 3 (Right - The Big One)**: "Low Osm" -> Assess VOLUME Status
    *   Hypovolemic (Dry)
    *   Euvolemic (Normal)
    *   Hypervolemic (Wet)

**THE SCRIPT:**
1.  **True vs. False**: First step is to rule out "fake" hyponatremia with Serum Osm.
2.  **Volume is King**: Once you know it's true hypotonic hyponatremia, look at the patient. Are they wet, dry, or normal?
3.  **Urine Na**: Helps distinguish renal vs. extra-renal loss in hypovolemia.

**THE WRAP-UP:**
- **Pearl**: "ADh" -> ADH is the hormone of water. Hyponatremia is a water problem, not a salt problem.

Quality Checks:
1. Is the board layout clear?
2. Is it short enough?
