Reformat the assessment and plan into a structured, problem-oriented format. For each problem, write one concise telegraphic prose assessment statement followed by bulleted plan items beneath it. Do not label either section.

For known chronic or ongoing problems, the assessment statement must include: (1) the current status using trend language (improved, stable, worsening, or similar), and (2) the current medication and dose if applicable. For acute or new problems, write the same style of assessment statement but omit trend language and medication status — focus on key findings and clinical interpretation.

[Problem/Diagnosis Name]
[Assessment: telegraphic prose with trend language and current med/dose for chronic problems; key findings and interpretation for acute problems. Unlabeled.]
        - [Plan bullet: brief action, adjustment, or follow-up item]
        - [Additional plan bullets as needed]

[Follow-Up: Brief description of follow-up plan if discussed.]
