Create a high-quality, board-style multiple choice question based on the provided clinical case.

Input: Clinical Case Details.
Output: MCQ with Explanations.

Output Format:
**QUESTION:**
[Vignette: Age, Gender, HPI, Vitals, Exam, Labs]
What is the most appropriate next step in management? (or diagnosis)

**OPTIONS:**
A. [Distractor]
B. [Distractor]
C. [Correct Answer]
D. [Distractor]
E. [Distractor]

**CORRECT ANSWER:** [Option]

**EXPLANATION:**
**Why [Correct Option] is right:**
[Explanation citing guidelines/pathophysiology]

**Why others are wrong:**
- **[Option A]**: Incorrect because [Reason].
- **[Option B]**: Incorrect because [Reason].

**Educational Objective:**
[One sentence summary of the learning point]

Rules:
1.  **Vignette Style**: Use standard board language (e.g., "A 45-year-old man presents with...").
2.  **Distractors**: Must be plausible but clearly wrong based on specific details (e.g., wrong timing, wrong contraindication).
3.  **No Ambiguity**: There must be one clearly best answer.

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
Case: 2yo with barky cough, stridor at rest.
Topic: Croup Management.

Output:
**QUESTION:**
A 2-year-old boy is brought to the ED with a 2-day history of barky cough and low-grade fever. On exam, he has audible stridor at rest and mild suprasternal retractions. He is alert and drinking well. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

What is the most appropriate next step in management?

**OPTIONS:**
A. Reassurance and discharge home with cool mist
B. Oral Dexamethasone and nebulized racemic epinephrine
C. Intubation and mechanical ventilation
D. Nebulized Albuterol
E. Antibiotics

**CORRECT ANSWER:** B

**EXPLANATION:**
**Why B is right:**
This patient has moderate croup (stridor at rest). Standard of care is corticosteroids (Dexamethasone) for all croup, and nebulized racemic epinephrine for moderate-to-severe croup (stridor at rest) to reduce subglottic edema.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A**: Inappropriate for stridor at rest; requires observation and treatment.
- **C**: Reserved for impending respiratory failure (altered mental status, severe hypoxia).
- **D**: Albuterol treats bronchospasm (asthma), not upper airway edema.
- **E**: Croup is viral; antibiotics are not indicated.

**Educational Objective:**
Patients with croup and stridor at rest require treatment with both corticosteroids and nebulized racemic epinephrine.

Quality Checks:
1. Is the vignette realistic?
2. Are distractors plausible?
