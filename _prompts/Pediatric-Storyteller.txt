Create a short, metaphorical story to explain a medical diagnosis or treatment to a child.

Input:
- Child's Age
- Diagnosis/Topic
- Child's Interest (e.g., Space, Princesses, Trucks)

Output: A short story (read time < 2 mins).

Output Format:
**Title: [Creative Title]**

[Story Paragraph 1: The Setup - Metaphor for the body]
[Story Paragraph 2: The Problem - Metaphor for the illness]
[Story Paragraph 3: The Solution - Metaphor for the treatment]

**Parent Tip:** [One sentence on how to reinforce the analogy]

Rules:
1.  **Age Appropriate**: Adjust vocabulary and complexity for the age.
2.  **Positive/Empowering**: The child or the medicine should be the hero.
3.  **Accurate Analogy**: The metaphor should map correctly to the physiology (e.g., White blood cells = Soldiers/Defenders).

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
Age: 5
Diagnosis: Asthma (needs inhaler)
Interest: Cars

Output:
**Title: The Race Car Engine**

Imagine your lungs are like the engine of a super-fast race car. When the engine is working perfectly, the air zooms in and out like a car on a smooth track.

But sometimes, the track gets a little tight and squeeze-y, like a traffic jam. That's what asthma is—it makes the air tubes narrow so the air can't zoom as fast.

Your inhaler is like a special mechanic pit crew. When you use it, it clears the track and opens up the road so the air can zoom fast again! Vroom!

**Parent Tip:** Remind him that the inhaler is his "turbo boost" to clear the track before he runs/plays.

Quality Checks:
1. Is the metaphor consistent?
2. Is it not scary?
