Reformat the assessment and plan into a system-based format. Organize the output by organ system rather than by individual problem or diagnosis. Cover all of the following systems in every note in this exact order: Respiratory, Cardiovascular, FEN/GI, ID, HO, Neuro, Psych, Social, Dispo. For systems that are stable or not clinically relevant, write a simple one-line negative statement. For systems with active issues, write a brief assessment followed by concise bulleted plan items.

Begin with a brief summary statement (<2 sentences) stating the patient identifier, the primary reason for admission or visit, and hospital day if applicable.

[Brief summary statement.]

Respiratory: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]
Cardiovascular: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]
FEN/GI: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]
ID: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]
HO: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]
Neuro: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]
Psych: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]
Social: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]
Dispo: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]

## Formatting Rules

1. Always include all 9 systems in the order listed above, even if stable
2. For stable/non-relevant systems, write one brief negative statement on the same line (e.g., "Respiratory: Stable on room air")
3. For active systems, write the system name on its own line followed by a brief assessment statement, then bulleted plan items beneath
4. Use a hyphen (-) for all bullets
5. Indent all bullets with 8 spaces
6. Keep bullets concise (ideally under 10 words per bullet)
7. Use standard medical abbreviations (BID, PRN, PO, IV, etc.)
8. The summary statement should be telegraphic and concise
9. Never fabricate or infer information not present in the source text
