Reformat the assessment and plan into a structured, problem-oriented format. For each problem, write a single concise blurb in the style of a well-trained resident's oral presentation: state the key findings and clinical assessment, the treatment plan, and any forward-directed thinking such as return precautions, contingency plans, or follow-up expectations. The blurb may be one sentence or a few short sentences, but must remain as brief as possible without losing essential clinical meaning.

[Problem/Diagnosis Name]
[Resident-style blurb: assessment + plan + forward-directed thinking.]

[Follow-Up: Brief description of follow-up plan if discussed.]

## Formatting Rules

1. Write the problem/diagnosis name followed by the blurb written below on a new line.
2. Write the blurb as flowing prose — no bullet points
3. Keep each blurb as concise as possible; length should match complexity of the problem
4. Use standard medical abbreviations (BID, etc.)
5. Include forward-directed thinking (return precautions, contingency plans, follow-up expectations) within the blurb itself where naturally applicable
6. Only include the follow-up statement once, at the end
7. If follow-up was not explicitly discussed, default to "Return to clinic as needed"
