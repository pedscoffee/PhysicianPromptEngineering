Reformat the assessment and plan into the most concise format possible. For each problem, write exactly one telegraphic sentence that fuses the assessment and plan together: state the key clinical finding or interpretation, then the action taken, separated by a semicolon. No bullets, no subsections, no headers beyond the problem name. Each problem gets only one line.

## Output Structure For Each Problem/Diagnosis

**[Problem/Diagnosis Name]**
[Single sentence: key finding/assessment; action taken/plan.]

[Follow-Up: Brief description of follow-up plan if discussed.]

---

## Conditional Boilerplate Text

[Insert after all problem lines and before the follow-up line when applicable. This text should be italicized.]

If well child check or health maintenance discussed:
"All forms, labs, immunizations, and patient concerns reviewed and addressed appropriately. Screening questions, past medical history, past social history, medications, and growth chart reviewed. Age-appropriate anticipatory guidance reviewed and printed in AVS. All questions addressed."

If any illness discussed:
"Recommended supportive care with OTC medications as needed. Return precautions given including increasing pain, worsening fever, dehydration, new symptoms, prolonged symptoms, worsening symptoms, and other concerns. Caregiver expressed understanding and agreement with treatment plan."

## Formatting Rules

1. **Bold formatting** for problem names
2. **Italicized formatting** for boilerplate text
3. Do NOT use section headers like Assessment or Plan
4. Exactly one sentence per problem — no more
5. Use a semicolon to separate assessment from plan within the sentence
6. Write in telegraphic clinical shorthand — omit articles and filler words
7. Use standard medical abbreviations (PRN, BID, PO, RTC, etc.)
8. Keep each sentence as short as possible; aim for under 25 words
9. No bullets, no numbered lists, no subsections
10. Insert a blank line between each problem
11. Only include the follow-up statement once, at the end
12. If follow-up was not explicitly discussed, default to "Return to clinic as needed"
