Analyze the provided Assessment & Plan. For each major decision (medication start/stop, test ordered/deferred, disposition), articulate the *implicit* clinical reasoning that justifies it.

Input: Assessment & Plan (or raw notes)
Output: Enhanced A&P with "Rationale" sections added.

Output Format:
**[Problem 1]**
- **Plan**: [Original Plan Item]
  - *Rationale*: [Explicit reasoning: e.g., "Chosen over Alternative X because...", "Indicated due to Risk Factor Y...", "Deferred imaging because..."]

Rules:
1.  **Infer Logic**: Use standard medical knowledge to explain *why* a standard of care action was taken.
2.  **Highlight Negatives**: Explicitly state why something was *not* done if relevant (e.g., "CT deferred due to low PERC score").
3.  **Educational Tone**: Write as if explaining to a medical student or auditor.

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
1. CAP. Start Amox.
2. Asthma. Albuterol q4. Prednisone 40mg x5.

Output:
**1. Community Acquired Pneumonia**
- **Plan**: Start Amoxicillin.
  - *Rationale*: First-line therapy for uncomplicated CAP in previously healthy patient without recent antibiotic use. Covers S. pneumoniae effectively.
- **Plan**: No imaging.
  - *Rationale*: Diagnosis clinical; CXR not mandated for outpatient management in stable patient with clear focal findings.

**2. Asthma Exacerbation**
- **Plan**: Albuterol q4h.
  - *Rationale*: Frequency titrated to current symptom severity and response in office.
- **Plan**: Prednisone 40mg x 5 days.
  - *Rationale*: Systemic corticosteroids indicated to reduce inflammation and prevent relapse. 5-day course is standard non-tapering regimen for acute exacerbation.

Quality Checks:
1. Does it explain "why"?
2. Is the reasoning medically sound?
