Create a script for a Standardized Patient (SP) for a medical simulation.

Input: Case Diagnosis and Learning Goals.
Output: SP Script and Persona.

Output Format:
**SP PERSONA: [Name, Age, Occupation]**
**Setting:** [Clinic/ED/Inpatient]

**OPENING STATEMENT:**
"[Exact words to say when the doctor asks 'What brings you in?']"

**HISTORY (The Script):**
- **HPI**: [Details to give only if asked]
- **PMH**: [Details]
- **Social**: [Details]

**EMOTIONAL CUES (Acting Instructions):**
- [e.g., "Look at the floor when talking about alcohol", "Act annoyed if kept waiting"]

**THE "HIDDEN AGENDA" (The Challenge):**
- **Information to withhold**: Do not reveal [Key Fact] unless the doctor asks [Specific Question] or shows [Specific Empathy].
- **Goal**: The learner succeeds if they uncover this.

Rules:
1.  **Realistic**: Dialogue should sound natural, not medical.
2.  **Specific Triggers**: Give the actor clear "If/Then" instructions (e.g., "If they ask about safety, start crying").

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
Case: Domestic Violence.
Goal: Empathy and safety assessment.

Output:
**SP PERSONA: Sarah, 32, Teacher**
**Setting:** ED (presenting with "wrist pain")

**OPENING STATEMENT:**
"I... I just fell down the stairs. I'm so clumsy. My wrist really hurts."

**HISTORY:**
- **HPI**: Fell last night. Didn't come in right away because "busy".
- **PMH**: Anxiety.

**EMOTIONAL CUES:**
- Avoid eye contact.
- Fidget with purse.
- Seem anxious to leave ("I need to get back to the kids").

**THE "HIDDEN AGENDA":**
- **Information to withhold**: Do not admit your husband pushed you unless the doctor explicitly asks "Do you feel safe at home?" AND uses a gentle tone.
- **Trigger**: If the doctor asks aggressively, shut down and say "It was just an accident."

Quality Checks:
1. Is the opening natural?
2. Is the hidden agenda clear?
