Reformat the assessment and plan into a system-based format. Organize the output by organ system rather than by individual problem or diagnosis. Cover all of the following systems in every note in this exact order: Respiratory, Cardiovascular, FEN/GI, ID, HO, Neuro, Psych, Social, Dispo. For systems that are stable or not clinically relevant, write a simple one-line negative statement. For systems with active issues, write a brief assessment followed by concise bulleted plan items.

Begin with a brief summary statement (<2 sentences) stating the patient identifier, the primary reason for admission or visit, and hospital day if applicable.

**FEN/GI**: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]
**ID**: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]
**HO**: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]
**Neuro**: [Assessment and plan, or simple negative statement]

## Formatting Rules

1. **Bold formatting** for the organ system names
2. Always include all 9 systems in the order listed above, even if stable
3. For stable/non-relevant systems, write one brief negative statement on the same line (e.g., "**Respiratory**: Stable on room air")
4. For active systems, put the assessment/plan on a new line or same line concisely
5. Use a hyphen (-) for all bulleted plan items
6. Write all bullet points in extremely brief, professional shorthand phrases
7. Keep bullets concise (ideally under 10 words per bullet)
8. Use standard medical abbreviations (BID, PRN, PO, IV, etc.)
9. The summary statement should be telegraphic and concise
10. Never fabricate or infer information not present in the source text
11. No references

## Few-Shot Examples

**8yo admitted for acute asthma exacerbation with hypoxia requiring supplemental O2; HD#2.**

**Respiratory**: Asthma exacerbation, improved on continuous albuterol, now spacing to q4h; weaning O2.
- Albuterol neb q4h
- Wean O2 to maintain SpO2 >92%
- Start Flovent 44mcg 2 puffs BID once spacing to q6h
- Continue monitoring respiratory status

**Cardiovascular**: Hemodynamically stable, no concerns.

**FEN/GI**: Tolerating regular diet, adequate PO intake.

**ID**: Afebrile, no signs of infection.

**HO**: No hematologic or oncologic concerns.

**Neuro**: Alert, age-appropriate, no focal deficits.

**Psych**: Appropriate affect, coping well with hospitalization.

**Social**: Parents at bedside, family meeting completed. School notified of absence.

**Dispo**: Likely discharge tomorrow if tolerating albuterol q6h on room air.
- Discharge with Flovent 44mcg 2 puffs BID, albuterol PRN
- Asthma action plan to family
- Follow-up with PCP in 1 week

**65yo presenting with fever, cough, and hypoxia; CXR with RLL consolidation consistent with community-acquired pneumonia.**

**Respiratory**: Right lower lobe pneumonia on CXR; requiring 2L NC to maintain SpO2 >94%.
- Supplemental O2 2L NC
- Chest PT and incentive spirometry
- Monitor respiratory status for clinical deterioration

**Cardiovascular**: Sinus tachycardia, likely demand; no acute cardiac concerns.

**FEN/GI**: Mild dehydration on presentation; tolerating sips.
- NS bolus 1L, then D5 1/2NS at 100mL/hr
- Advance diet as tolerated

**ID**: Febrile to 39.1C; WBC 15.2 with left shift. Blood cultures drawn.
- Ceftriaxone 1g IV daily + azithromycin 500mg IV daily
- Monitor fever curve and WBC trend
- Follow blood cultures

**HO**: No hematologic or oncologic concerns.

**Neuro**: Alert and oriented x4, no focal deficits.

**Psych**: Anxious about hospitalization; reassurance provided.

**Social**: Lives alone; daughter is emergency contact and updated. Will need to assess home safety prior to discharge.

**Dispo**: Admit to medicine for IV antibiotics and O2 monitoring.
- Anticipated 2-3 day stay
- Transition to PO antibiotics when afebrile x24h and tolerating PO
- Follow-up with PCP within 1 week of discharge
