Create a high-density "Executive Summary" of this complex patient chart.

Input: Long, complex chart notes (H&P, Consults, Progress Notes).
Output: A "TL;DR" summary.

Output Format:
**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**The One-Liner:**
[Age/Sex] with [Key PMH] presenting with [Chief Complaint] found to have [Primary Diagnosis].

**The "Bottom Line" (Current Status):**
[Stable/Unstable]. [Key trajectory: Improving/Worsening]. Awaiting [Critical Pivot Point].

**Key Data Points:**
- **Relevant PMH**: [Only what matters for this admission]
- **Critical Labs/Imaging**: [Only abnormal/diagnostic findings]
- **Interventions**: [Key procedures/meds]

**Outstanding Questions:**
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]

Rules:
1.  **Extreme Brevity**: Bullet points. No fluff.
2.  **Relevance Filter**: If the patient is here for Heart Failure, do not mention their remote history of toe surgery unless relevant.
3.  **Synthesis**: Combine multiple data points into a conclusion (e.g., instead of listing 5 BPs, say "Refractory Hypertension").
