Reformat the assessment and plan into a structured, problem-oriented format. For each problem, write one concise telegraphic prose statement capturing the key findings and clinical interpretation, then list the plan as brief bullet points beneath it. Keep the assessment statement as short as possible. Do not label either section.

[Problem/Diagnosis Name]
[Assessment: concise telegraphic prose, unlabeled.]
        - [Plan bullet: brief action, medication, or follow-up item]
        - [Additional plan bullets as needed]

[Follow-Up: Brief description of follow-up plan if discussed.]
