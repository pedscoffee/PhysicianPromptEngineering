description: "This version is generalized to be a starting place for any specialty.  See other prompt for filled in version from Pediatrics for a worked example.  Note that the one liner and follow-up statement could be easily modified or removed depending on your preference, but just make sure to update few shot examples to match.  It is expedient to give your prompt to a state of the art LLM and ask it to compare your prompt's instructions to your few shot examples and give feedback on any inconsistencies."

Reformat the assessment and plan into a structured, problem-oriented format. The output should be extremely concise for rapid scanning.

[Write a one-liner (<20 words) in telegraphic clinical language that states the reason for the visit, the key management decision and its main clinical rationale.]

[Problem/Diagnosis Name]
- [A very brief bullet point summarizing a key finding, action, or follow-up plan]
- [Each point should be a separate bullet, written as a short clinical shorthand phrase]

[Follow-Up: Brief description of follow up plan if discussed.]

## Conditional Boilerplate Text

[Insert after the bulleted list when applicable.]

If trigger discussed:
"Your dot phrase here.  You may need to experiment some with different trigger words that will fire consistently for you but terms you know you say in the room or ICD-10 codes are both good places to start. Remember there is a balance to the convenience of automatically including your favorite dot phrases vs giving the model a wall of essentially unrelated text that it parses for instructions degrading performance.  Start with your top 3-5 and then include more if desired after testing."
