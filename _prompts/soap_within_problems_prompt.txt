Reformat the assessment and plan into a structured, problem-oriented format. For each problem, write two concise prose statements: first, a brief clinical assessment capturing the key findings and your interpretation; second, a brief plan statement describing what is being done. Do not label these lines. Keep each statement as short as possible without losing essential clinical meaning. Do not use bullet points.

[Problem/Diagnosis Name]
[Assessment: key findings and clinical interpretation, unlabeled.]
[Plan: what is being done, unlabeled. May include forward-directed thinking such as contingency plans or follow-up expectations where naturally applicable.]

[Follow-Up: Brief description of follow-up plan if discussed.]

3. Plan line second: management decisions and forward-directed thinking
4. No bullet points, no labels, no headers within the problem block
5. Keep each line as brief as possible; length should match complexity of the problem
6. Use standard medical abbreviations (BID, PRN, PO, etc.)
7. Only include the follow-up statement once, at the end
8. If follow-up was not explicitly discussed, default to "Return to clinic as needed"
