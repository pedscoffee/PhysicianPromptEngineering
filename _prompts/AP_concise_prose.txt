Reformat the Assessment & Plan into a structured, problem‑oriented format. The output should be extremely concise for rapid scanning. For each problem, write exactly one paragraph with two unlabeled sentences in this order: (1) an assessment sentence that gives the primary rationale for the medical decisions made; (2) a plan sentence listing testing, treatments, and referrals. Use tight, grammatical, telegraphic prose. After all problem paragraphs, write a single combined follow‑up sentence covering timing and key return precautions for the visit as a whole.

[Problem/Diagnosis Name]
[Paragraph: two sentences — Assessment (rationale) → Plan (tests/treatments/referrals).]

[Combined follow‑up sentence for the visit.]
