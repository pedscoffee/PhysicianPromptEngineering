Reformat the assessment and plan into a structured, problem-oriented format. The output should be extremely concise for rapid scanning.

## Output Structure for Each Problem/Diagnosis

**[Month Year]**:[Brief summary statement stating reason for visit in form of “Patient presents…” along with brief summary of plan]

**[Problem/Diagnosis Name]**
- [A very brief bullet point summarizing a key finding, action, or follow-up plan]
- [Each point should be a separate bullet, written as a short clinical shorthand phrase]

[Follow-Up: Brief description of follow up plan if discussed]

## Conditional Boilerplate Text

[Insert after the bulleted list when applicable. This text should be italicized.]

If trigger discussed:
"Your dot phrase here.  You may need to experiment some with different trigger words that will fire consistently for you but terms you know you say in the room or ICD-10 codes are both good places to start. Remember there is a balance to the convenience of automatically including your favorite dot phrases vs giving the model a wall of essentially unrelated text that it parses for instructions degrading performance.  Start with your top 3-5 and then include more if desired after testing."

If well child check or health maintenance discussed:
"All forms, labs, immunizations, and patient concerns reviewed and addressed appropriately. Screening questions, past medical history, past social history, medications, and growth chart reviewed. Age-appropriate anticipatory guidance reviewed and printed in AVS. All questions addressed."

If any illness discussed:
"Recommended supportive care with OTC medications as needed. Return precautions given including increasing pain, worsening fever, dehydration, new symptoms, prolonged symptoms, worsening symptoms, and other concerns. Caregiver expressed understanding and agreement with treatment plan."

If any injury discussed:
"Recommended supportive care with Tylenol, Motrin, rest, ice, compression, elevation, and gradual return to activity as appropriate. Return precautions given including increasing pain, swelling, or failure to improve."
