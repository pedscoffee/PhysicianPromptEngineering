title: "Teaching - Case Presentation, Learning Objectives, Discussion Questions, and Pearls"
description: "Transforms clinical notes into de-identified teaching cases with learning objectives, discussion questions, and teaching points. Do not trust the prompt to fully de-identify patient information.  Ensure HIPAA and fully regulatory compliance through appropriate channels as appropriate.  For these reasons do not recommend exporting outputs from outside the chart.  I recommend using this prompt to tee up in the moment chalk talks and then deleting. This may be my favorite of the entire library so far."

Convert this clinical note into a structured teaching case. Remove all identifying information and create educational content suitable for medical students or residents.

Output Structure
CASE PRESENTATION [Rewrite the case in standard presentation format: Demographics (age/gender only), Chief Complaint, HPI, Pertinent Physical Exam, Assessment and Plan]
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1.	[Specific, measurable objective related to diagnosis]
2.	[Specific, measurable objective related to management]
3.	[Specific, measurable objective related to clinical reasoning]
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1.	[Open-ended question about differential diagnosis]
2.	[Question about diagnostic approach or testing]
3.	[Question about management decisions]
4.	[Question about when to escalate or refer]
KEY TEACHING POINTS
·	[Clinical pearl #1]
·	[Clinical pearl #2]
·	[Clinical pearl #3]

De-identification Rules
1.	Replace specific ages with age ranges (e.g., "7-year-old" becomes "school-age child")
2.	Remove all names, use "the patient" or "the child"
3.	Remove specific dates, use relative timeframes ("presented 3 days after symptom onset")
4.	Keep clinical details intact - diagnosis, symptoms, exam findings, management
5.	Preserve medication names, doses, and clinical decision-making

Few-Shot Examples
Input: 5yo male, fever 102.5 x 2 days, sore throat, + strep test, started amoxicillin
Output:
CASE PRESENTATION A preschool-age male presented with 2 days of fever (max 102.5°F) and sore throat. Physical exam revealed tonsillar exudates and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Rapid strep test was positive. The patient was started on amoxicillin 50mg/kg/day divided BID for 10 days.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1.	Apply Centor criteria to determine when strep testing is indicated in pediatric pharyngitis
2.	Prescribe appropriate antibiotic therapy for group A streptococcal pharyngitis
3.	Counsel families on complications of untreated strep throat
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1.	What clinical features increase the likelihood of bacterial vs viral pharyngitis in children?
2.	When is empiric antibiotic therapy appropriate without testing?
3.	How would management change if the patient had a penicillin allergy?
4.	What are the potential complications of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis?
KEY TEACHING POINTS
·	Centor criteria have limited utility in children under age 3
·	Amoxicillin remains first-line therapy due to narrow spectrum and efficacy
·	Symptoms improve within 48-72 hours but full 10-day course prevents complications

Input: 16yo female with worsening asthma, using albuterol 5-6x/day, nighttime cough, exam with mild expiratory wheeze, not on controller, started Flovent 88mcg BID
Output:
CASE PRESENTATION An adolescent female with known asthma presented with worsening symptoms over the past 2 weeks. She reported using her albuterol rescue inhaler 5-6 times daily and experiencing nighttime cough 3-4 times per week. She was not on controller medication. Physical exam revealed mild expiratory wheezing bilaterally. She was started on fluticasone 88mcg 2 puffs twice daily with spacer and counseled on proper inhaler technique.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1.	Classify asthma severity using NHLBI guidelines
2.	Recognize indications for initiating controller therapy in asthma
3.	Prescribe appropriate step therapy for persistent asthma
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1.	How do you differentiate mild intermittent from mild persistent asthma?
2.	What factors indicate the need for controller medication vs rescue therapy alone?
3.	What would prompt escalation to Step 3 or 4 therapy?
4.	How would you counsel this patient on proper inhaler technique and adherence?
KEY TEACHING POINTS
·	Rescue inhaler use >2 days/week indicates inadequate control and need for controller
·	Nighttime symptoms are a key marker of persistent asthma
·	Spacers improve medication delivery and reduce oral thrush risk with ICS
