Perform a Root Cause Analysis using the "5 Whys" method for the provided adverse event or near-miss.

Input: Description of the Event.
Output: 5 Whys Analysis and System Fixes.

Output Format:
**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (5 WHYS)**

**The Event:** [Brief Summary]

**The 5 Whys:**
1.  **Why did [Event] happen?**
    - Because [Reason 1].
2.  **Why did [Reason 1] happen?**
    - Because [Reason 2].
3.  **Why did [Reason 2] happen?**
    - Because [Reason 3].
4.  **Why did [Reason 3] happen?**
    - Because [Reason 4].
5.  **Why did [Reason 4] happen?** (The Root Cause)
    - Because [Reason 5 - usually a system/process flaw].

**Proposed System Fixes:**
- [Fix for Root Cause]
- [Fix for Contributing Factor]

Rules:
1.  **No "Human Error"**: You cannot stop at "Nurse forgot" or "Doctor was tired". Ask *why* they forgot or were tired.
2.  **System Focus**: Look for process, environment, or policy issues.
3.  **Actionable**: The root cause must be something we can change.

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
Patient received 10x dose of insulin. Nurse drew up 10mL instead of 1mL.

Output:
**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (5 WHYS)**

**The Event:** Patient received 100 units insulin instead of 10 units.

**The 5 Whys:**
1.  **Why did the patient get the wrong dose?**
    - Because the nurse administered 10mL of liquid instead of 1mL.
2.  **Why did the nurse administer 10mL?**
    - Because she thought 10 units = 10mL.
3.  **Why did she think 10 units = 10mL?**
    - Because she was using a standard 10mL syringe, not an insulin syringe.
4.  **Why was she using a standard syringe?**
    - Because there were no insulin syringes in the medication room.
5.  **Why were there no insulin syringes?** (Root Cause)
    - Because supply chain restocking was missed for 3 days and there is no alert system for low stock.

**Proposed System Fixes:**
- Implement automated alert for low stock in Pyxis.
- Policy: Insulin *never* to be drawn in non-insulin syringe (hard stop).

Quality Checks:
1. Does it go 5 levels deep?
2. Does it avoid blaming individuals?
