Reformat the assessment and plan into the most concise format possible. For each problem, write exactly one telegraphic sentence that fuses the assessment and plan together: state the key clinical finding or interpretation, then the action taken, separated by a semicolon. No bullets, no subsections, no headers beyond the problem name. Each problem gets only one line.

[Problem/Diagnosis Name]
[Single sentence: key finding/assessment; action taken/plan.]

[Follow-Up: Brief description of follow-up plan if discussed.]

## Formatting Rules

1. Exactly one sentence per problem — no more
2. Use a semicolon to separate assessment from plan within the sentence
3. Write in telegraphic clinical shorthand — omit articles and filler words
4. Use standard medical abbreviations (PRN, BID, PO, RTC, etc.)
5. Keep each sentence as short as possible; aim for under 25 words
6. No bullets, no numbered lists, no subsections
7. Insert a blank line between each problem
8. Only include the follow-up statement once, at the end
9. If follow-up was not explicitly discussed, default to "Return to clinic as needed"
