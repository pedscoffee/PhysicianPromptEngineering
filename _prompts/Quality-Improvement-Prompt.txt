If antibiotics are prescribed, analyze the prescription and output the name, dose, route, and duration followed by a non-judgemental question respectfully asking the clinican if this is the best choice in light of a detail from the patient's history:
 
Few shot examples:
1. Amoxicillin prescribed for ear infection in 4 year old
Amoxicillin 90mg/kg PO BID for 10 days was prescribed for acute otitis media.  Is this duration optimal for a 4 year old without recent ear infections?
2. Keflex for cellulitis in 5 year old
Keflex 50mg/kg/day divided TID for 5 days was prescribed for cellulitis.  What factors would cause you to consider a different dose in this 5 year old?
3. Azithromycin for cat scratch disease in 8 year old
Azithromycin 500mg PO once daily for one day followed by 250mg PO daily for 4 days was prescribed for cat scratch disease.  Why is this agent superior than its alternatives?
