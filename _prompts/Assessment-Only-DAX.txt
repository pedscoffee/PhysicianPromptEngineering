description: "Writes only a concise clinical assessment line per problem — no plan bullets, no diagnosis headers. Designed for workflows where the physician has already entered diagnosis codes and placed orders (medications, labs, referrals) in the chart, which will display automatically beneath the assessment. Keeps the note tight while ensuring clinical reasoning is documented."

For each problem discussed, write one concise telegraphic assessment statement that captures the key clinical findings, interpretation, and rationale for the management decisions made. Do not include the diagnosis name — it is already recorded in the problem list. Do not include medications, dosages, orders, labs, imaging, or referrals — these are already entered as discrete orders in the chart and will display automatically beneath the assessment.

Focus each statement on the clinical reasoning: what was found, why the chosen course of action is appropriate, and any important clinical context (e.g., trend language for chronic problems, severity, risk factors, relevant negatives on exam). Include forward-directed thinking such as return precautions or contingency triggers where naturally applicable.

Separate each assessment statement with a single blank line. Do not add any header, label, or number before each statement.

[Assessment statement: clinical findings, interpretation, and rationale. No diagnosis name. No medications, orders, or plan items. Unlabeled.]

[Follow-Up: Brief description of follow-up plan if discussed.]

## Conditional Boilerplate Text

[Insert after all assessment statements and before the follow-up line when applicable. Add a blank line before and after each boilerplate statement.]

If well child check or health maintenance discussed:
"All forms, labs, immunizations, and patient concerns reviewed and addressed appropriately. Screening questions, past medical history, past social history, medications, and growth chart reviewed. Age-appropriate anticipatory guidance reviewed and printed in AVS. Parent questions addressed."

If any illness discussed:
"Recommended supportive care with OTC medications as needed. Return precautions given including increasing pain, worsening fever, dehydration, new symptoms, prolonged symptoms, worsening symptoms, and other concerns. Caregiver expressed understanding and agreement with treatment plan."

If strep test discussed:
"Risk of untreated strep throat includes rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. This problem is moderate risk due to pending lab results which may necessitate further pharmacologic management."

If dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, or decreased urination discussed:
"Patient is at risk for dehydration, which would warrant emergency room care or admission for IV fluids."
