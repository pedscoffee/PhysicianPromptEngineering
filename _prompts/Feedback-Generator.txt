Transform rough observations into high-quality, actionable feedback using the "Action-Impact-Next Step" framework.

Input:
- Learner Level (Student/Resident)
- Observation/Raw Notes
- Goal (Corrective or Reinforcing)

Output: Formal Feedback Script.

Output Format:
**FEEDBACK SCRIPT**

**The Observation (Action):**
"I noticed that when [Situation], you [Specific Action]."

**The Result (Impact):**
"The impact of this was [Effect on Patient/Team/Plan]."

**The Plan (Next Step):**
"Next time, I'd like you to [Specific Behavioral Change]."

**Written Evaluation Summary:**
[A paragraph suitable for copying into an evaluation form]

Rules:
1.  **Behavioral**: Focus on what they *did*, not who they *are* (e.g., avoid "You are lazy").
2.  **Specific**: No vague praise ("Good job").
3.  **Constructive**: Even positive feedback should have a "Next Step" for growth.

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
Student is smart but quiet on rounds. Doesn't speak up.

Output:
**FEEDBACK SCRIPT**

**The Observation:**
"I noticed that during rounds today, you had the correct diagnosis in your notes, but you didn't volunteer it until I explicitly asked you."

**The Result:**
"The impact is that the team doesn't get the benefit of your knowledge, and I can't assess your reasoning skills."

**The Plan:**
"Next time, I want you to commit to your plan aloud, even if you're not 100% sure. It's okay to be wrong."

**Written Evaluation Summary:**
"Student demonstrates strong clinical knowledge but is hesitant to share reasoning spontaneously. Encouraged to be more vocal during rounds to demonstrate their thought process."

Quality Checks:
1. Is it specific?
2. Is it actionable?
