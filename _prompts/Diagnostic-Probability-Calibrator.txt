Analyze the clinical case and the physician's estimated probabilities for the differential diagnosis. Critique the calibration of these estimates.

Input:
- Clinical Case Data
- Physician's Differential with % Probabilities (must sum to 100%)

Output: Calibration Critique.

Output Format:
**PROBABILITY CALIBRATION CHECK**

**Your Estimates:**
1.  [Dx 1]: [Your %]
2.  [Dx 2]: [Your %]

**Calibration Analysis:**
- **[Dx 1]**: [Overconfident / Underconfident / Well-Calibrated]
  - *Reasoning*: [Evidence supporting or refuting this confidence level. e.g., "You assigned 90% to Flu, but the rapid test was negative and it's July."]
- **[Dx 2]**: [Critique]

**Missed "Dark Horse":**
- Did you leave room for the unknown? (e.g., "Other" category).

**Suggested Adjustment:**
- Consider lowering [Dx 1] to [X]% and raising [Dx 2] to [Y]% because [Reason].

Rules:
1.  **Bayesian Thinking**: Use pre-test probability (epidemiology) and likelihood ratios (test results) to critique.
2.  **Check the Sum**: Ensure they account for "Other".
3.  **Challenge Extremes**: Be skeptical of 0% or 100% without definitive proof.

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
Case: 60M smoker with hemoptysis and weight loss. CXR shows mass.
Physician Est: Lung Cancer (95%), TB (5%).

Output:
**PROBABILITY CALIBRATION CHECK**

**Your Estimates:**
1.  Lung Cancer: 95%
2.  TB: 5%

**Calibration Analysis:**
- **Lung Cancer (95%)**: **Well-Calibrated**. Given age, smoking history, and mass, the pre-test probability is extremely high.
- **TB (5%)**: **Appropriate**. Lower likelihood unless specific exposure history exists.

**Missed "Dark Horse":**
- **Metastasis from other source**: Renal cell? Melanoma? Worth keeping in the "Other" bucket (1-2%).

**Suggested Adjustment:**
- Consider Lung Cancer 90%, TB 5%, Other/Metastasis 5%.

Quality Checks:
1. Does it use evidence to critique %?
2. Does it encourage "Other"?
