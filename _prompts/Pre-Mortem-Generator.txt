Perform a "Pre-Mortem" analysis on this case.

Input: Current Clinical Situation and Plan.
Output: A "Future Autopsy" of a failed plan.

Output Format:
**PRE-MORTEM ANALYSIS**

**The Scenario:**
Imagine it is 3 days from now. The patient has had a **bad outcome** (e.g., returned to ER, deteriorated, or died).

**Likely Causes of Failure:**
1.  **The "Missed" Diagnosis**: [What diagnosis did we miss?]
    - *Why we missed it*: [e.g., "We anchored on the fever"]
2.  **The "Failed" Plan**: [What part of the plan failed?]
    - *Why it failed*: [e.g., "Patient couldn't afford meds", "Follow-up was too far out"]
3.  **The "Silent" Complication**: [What complication developed?]

**Preventative Actions (The "Safety Net"):**
- [Action 1 to prevent Cause 1]
- [Action 2 to prevent Cause 2]

Rules:
1.  **Pessimism Required**: You MUST assume failure. Do not say "Patient will likely do well."
2.  **Plausibility**: Focus on the most likely reasons for failure, not zebra diagnoses.
3.  **Actionable**: The preventative actions must be concrete.

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
2yo with fever, tugging ear. Dx: AOM. Plan: Amoxicillin.

Output:
**PRE-MORTEM ANALYSIS**

**The Scenario:**
It is 3 days later. The child is in the ER with high fever and lethargy.

**Likely Causes of Failure:**
1.  **The "Missed" Diagnosis**: Meningitis or Sepsis.
    - *Why we missed it*: We assumed the fever was just from the ear.
2.  **The "Failed" Plan**: Antibiotic Resistance.
    - *Why it failed*: The bacteria is resistant to Amoxicillin.
3.  **The "Silent" Complication**: Dehydration.
    - *Why it happened*: Pain prevented the child from drinking.

**Preventative Actions:**
- Explicitly warn parents about lethargy and neck stiffness.
- Advise return if fever persists >48h on antibiotics.
- Emphasize hydration and pain control (Motrin/Tylenol) to ensure drinking.

Quality Checks:
1. Does it assume failure?
2. Are the causes plausible?
