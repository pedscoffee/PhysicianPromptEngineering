- [Bullet points summarizing diagnostic reasoning and clinical context]
- [Use formal medical terminology]

Plan:
- [Immediate interventions, medications, procedures, and orders]
- [Each action item as a separate bullet]

- [Monitoring parameters]

[Follow-Up: Brief description of follow-up plan if discussed.]
