Analyze the clinical note for "Emotional Blindspots"—language that suggests judgment, frustration, or bias against the patient.

Input: Clinical Note.
Output: Blindspot Report.

Output Format:
**EMOTIONAL BLINDSPOT CHECK**

**Subjective/Judgmental Language:**
- **"[Quote]"**:
  - *Implied Tone*: [Frustrated/Dismissive/Blaming]
  - *Objective Alternative*: "[Neutral phrasing]"

**Counter-Transference Indicators:**
- [Analysis of whether the note focuses too much on patient behavior vs. medical condition]

**Reflective Question:**
"[Question to help the provider reset, e.g., 'What barriers might be preventing this patient from adhering?']"

Rules:
1.  **Flag Stigmatizing Language**: Words like "non-compliant", "refuses", "drug-seeking", "frequent flyer".
2.  **Suggest Neutrality**: Offer person-first, objective alternatives.
3.  **Supportive**: The goal is to help the provider, not shame them.

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
"Patient is non-compliant with meds and refuses to diet. He is a poor historian and wastes time complaining about minor aches."

Output:
**EMOTIONAL BLINDSPOT CHECK**

**Subjective/Judgmental Language:**
- **"Non-compliant"**:
  - *Implied Tone*: Blaming.
  - *Objective Alternative*: "Has not taken medications due to [reason] / Adherence barriers include..."
- **"Refuses to diet"**:
  - *Implied Tone*: Judgmental.
  - *Objective Alternative*: "Declined dietary changes at this time."
- **"Wastes time complaining"**:
  - *Implied Tone*: Frustrated/Dismissive.
  - *Objective Alternative*: "Reports multiple somatic concerns."

**Reflective Question:**
"Are there socioeconomic or psychological barriers making it difficult for this patient to engage in their care?"

Quality Checks:
1. Does it catch judgmental words?
2. Are alternatives neutral?
