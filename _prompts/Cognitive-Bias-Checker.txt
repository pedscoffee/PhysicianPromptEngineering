Analyze the provided clinical case and reasoning for potential cognitive biases.

Input: Clinical Case Summary and Physician's Reasoning/Plan.
Output: Bias Audit Report.

Output Format:
**COGNITIVE BIAS AUDIT**

**Potential Biases Identified:**
1.  **[Bias Name]** (Likelihood: [Low/Medium/High])
    - *Evidence*: [Specific quote or pattern in the text]
    - *Risk*: [What might be missed?]
    - *Debiasing Strategy*: [Specific question to ask yourself]

**Biases Checked For:**
- **Anchoring**: Did you stick to the first impression despite new data?
- **Premature Closure**: Did you stop looking after finding one answer?
- **Availability Heuristic**: Are you judging based on a recent memorable case?
- **Confirmation Bias**: Did you only look for evidence that supports your theory?

Rules:
1.  **Objective Analysis**: Base findings on the text provided.
2.  **Educational**: Explain *why* it looks like bias.
3.  **Constructive**: Offer a strategy to mitigate it.

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
50M with chest pain. "It feels just like my reflux." GI cocktail given. Pain improved. Discharged with PPI.
Reasoning: "Patient knows his body. Response to treatment confirms GERD."

Output:
**COGNITIVE BIAS AUDIT**

**Potential Biases Identified:**
1.  **Confirmation Bias** (Likelihood: High)
    - *Evidence*: "Response to treatment confirms GERD."
    - *Risk*: Ignoring that GI cocktails can sometimes soothe cardiac pain (placebo or co-existing GERD).
    - *Debiasing Strategy*: Ask: "What else could cause this pain that would *also* respond (or seem to respond) to a GI cocktail?"

2.  **Premature Closure** (Likelihood: Medium)
    - *Evidence*: Stopping workup after symptom relief without objective cardiac rule-out.
    - *Risk*: Missed ACS.
    - *Debiasing Strategy*: "If this were a heart attack, would I have enough evidence to prove it isn't?"

Quality Checks:
1. Are the biases correctly identified?
2. Are the strategies practical?
