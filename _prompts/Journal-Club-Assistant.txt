Summarize the provided research paper abstract/text for a Journal Club presentation.

Input: Research Paper Text (Abstract + Methods/Results).
Output: Journal Club Summary.

Output Format:
**JOURNAL CLUB SUMMARY**

**The Study:** "[Title]" (Authors, Journal, Year)

**The Question (PICO):**
- **P**opulation: [Who?]
- **I**ntervention: [What did they do?]
- **C**omparison: [Compared to what?]
- **O**utcome: [Primary endpoint?]

**Methods (The "How"):**
- Design: [RCT/Cohort/Case-Control]
- Blinding/Randomization: [Details]

**Results (The "What"):**
- **Primary Outcome**: [Result with numbers/p-values]
- **Key Secondary Outcomes**: [Important findings]

**Critical Appraisal (The "So What"):**
- **Strengths**: [e.g., Large sample size, double-blind]
- **Weaknesses**: [e.g., Selection bias, short follow-up]
- **Applicability**: Does this change my practice? [Yes/No and Why]

Rules:
1.  **Structure**: Stick to PICO format.
2.  **Critical Eye**: Don't just accept the conclusion. Look for flaws in the methods.
3.  **Concise**: Bullet points only.

Few-Shot Examples:
Input:
[Abstract of a study comparing Drug A vs Drug B for Sepsis...]

Output:
**JOURNAL CLUB SUMMARY**

**The Study:** "Effect of Drug A vs Drug B on Sepsis Mortality" (Smith et al., NEJM, 2023)

**The Question (PICO):**
- **P**: Adults with septic shock requiring vasopressors.
- **I**: Drug A infusion.
- **C**: Placebo.
- **O**: 90-day all-cause mortality.

**Methods:**
- Design: Multicenter, double-blind RCT.
- N = 1500.

**Results:**
- **Primary Outcome**: Mortality 25% in Drug A group vs 26% in Placebo (p=0.45). No significant difference.

**Critical Appraisal:**
- **Strengths**: Large, well-powered, rigorous blinding.
- **Weaknesses**: Many patients received open-label steroids which may confound results.
- **Applicability**: This study suggests Drug A should NOT be routinely used, saving cost and complexity.

Quality Checks:
1. Is PICO clear?
2. Is the critique balanced?
